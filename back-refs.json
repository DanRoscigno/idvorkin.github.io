This book applies the negotiating principles to yourself.\n\nThis is a summary of Getting to yes with yourself\n\n1) Put yourself in your shoes \u00e2\u0098\u0091\n\n\n  Figure out what your elephant REALLY wants (Switch)\n  Seek first to understand yourself (7H)\n  When you judge yourself, you shutdown and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t find what you really want\n  Acceptance induces safety, and only from safety can you find what you really want\n  See yourself form the balcony\n    \n      Respond instead of reacting.\n      Going to Balcony == Be Mindful, Self Aware and Objective\n      Choose your response, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a two sided stick and you get the consequences.\n      Reaction:\n        \n          Feels good, but need to realize there is a VERY negative consequence.\n          Negative Reactions: Attack (Win:Lose) -> Accommodate (Lose:Win) -> Avoid (Lose:Lose)\n        \n      \n      Use self-awareness to catch your desire to react\n        \n          Need to build self-awareness muscle (SIY)\n          Practice mindfulness (and have a grounding spot)\n          Practice mindfulness before event to make it easier.\n        \n      \n    \n  \n  Listen with Empathy\n    \n      80% of thoughts are negative.\n      Observe self: Detached view of a scientist.\n      Listen to self: What it feels like to be you.\n      Listening to self exercise\n        \n          Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t judge, or they will not feel safe, and won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t talk.\n          Name your neurosis, and sit them down at a table, and listen to them non-judgementally\n          Because \u00e2\u0080\u009cnegative emotions are safe to speak\u00e2\u0080\u009d they get less power, and have less desire to attack at \u00e2\u0080\u009cbad\u00e2\u0080\u009d times.\n          Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just listen, understand the cause, and what you can do to help.\n          Be curious, ask yourself, isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t that interesting. Ask the neurosis, why is that.\n        \n      \n      This is an opportunity to learn physical self awareness, to help notice your emotions.\n      Huge benefit, your mind is more clear, and you silence the self to concentrate and get into flow.\n    \n  \n  Uncover your needs\n    \n      Your elephant is non-verbal, negative emotions are it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mode of communicating your needs.\n      Dig hard for your needs, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t settle for a position, but why, what do you really want. What is done. (XREF: Essentialisim)\n      Magic Question Why? Why? Why?\n      Deepest needs: Happiness: Protection/Safety and Love/Connection\n    \n  \n  From Self Judgment to Self Understanding\n    \n      Before fighting with others, need to make sure you TRUELY know what you want.\n      Accepting yourself for who you are is NOT a cop out. Acceptance produces safety, which lets us digg deater.\n    \n  \n\n\n2) Develop your inner BATNA \u00e2\u0098\u0091\n\nThe ideas in this chapter are great, but I think connecting the concepts to inner BATNA is ackward. Thus my summary doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t track well with the books\n\n\n  A cross between 7H: Be Proactive, AND take responsibility for meeting your own needs.\n  When you COMMIT to unconditionally take care of your needs, you have all the power.\n    \n      SWITCH: Your elephant can rest assured it will be fed and cared for regardless of what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going on externally.\n      This gives you much more psychic space in your relationships, making them better relationships.\n      SIY: Grandmother mind - you are your own best grandma.\n    \n  \n  Responsibility holds Power VS blame gives it away.\n  Take responsibility for what you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got, and make the most of it - DO NOT BLAME Life (welcome to Holland).\n  Focus on what you can do to make things better, NOT the fact that you screwed something up in the past.\n  \n    In a relationship, focus on what YOU CAN DO going forward in the relationship, not on blaming the other person.

      "description": "Internal incubations are fun, but I love shipping products. In the case of Microsoft Cache, before I joined, the team had been incubating OneClip, and needed help bringing it to market. My self and a top tier product manager joined the team to help them ship. We immediately got to work, recruiting senior talent, and closing the gaps. We tackled the technical, product market fit, and logistical issues required to bring the product to market.\n\nYou can see the\n\n\n\nfeatures we shipped\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhile the Slashgear article below captures the story well \u00e2\u0080\u00a6\n</span>\n\nInstead of simply keeping all its eggs in its own Window 10 or Windows 10 Mobile basket, Microsoft, either officially or through its Garage skunkworks arm, has been steadily putting out mobile apps that cross the platform divide into iOS and Android territory, ranging from the useful to the insane. One of the latest, fortunately, straddles the useful category. Microsoft Garage\u00e2\u0080\u0099s new Cache app lets you clip anything and sync those between Windows and iOS devices. We say \u00e2\u0080\u009cnew\u00e2\u0080\u009d because, truth be told, it sounds a lot like Microsoft\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cOneClip\u00e2\u0080\u009d tool from last year.\n\n\n\nAs part of its attempt to modernize its Office suite, Microsoft was spotted working on some new \u00e2\u0080\u009csmart\u00e2\u0080\u009d tools, one of which was OneClip. Taking a cue perhaps from OneNote, OneClip would have given users a sort of \u00e2\u0080\u009cstash\u00e2\u0080\u009d for notes, links, images, and files, accessible from any device. We haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t heard from OneClip since, but that might all be moot now if it has, indeed, evolved into \u00e2\u0080\u009cCache\u00e2\u0080\u009d.\n\n\n\nThe basic premise of Cache is totally the same, just independent of Microsoft Office, has a nice interface, and has more features. For example, it remembers where and when you \u00e2\u0080\u009cclipped\u00e2\u0080\u009d an object, so you can get back to the source if you need it. You can also organize Cache\u00e2\u0080\u0099s contents by date or into your own custom grouping.\n\nBut best of all, Cache isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t limited to Windows only. It works on iOS too and the cache is synced on both devices through the cloud. An Android app is still missing, though, and no word yet on when, or even if, that is coming. It would be a terrible shame if it didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t.\n",

      "description": "Stop. Take an ice cold shower right now. You didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t, did you? Trust me, even if you tried, you wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t. Before you turned on the water, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d have this irrational fear of stepping in and you wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do it. The force that stops you is the resistance. The resistance is the personification of the force that stops you from doing the important. The resistance lies, telling us things are hard, when they are not. The resistance adds suffering, when there is minimal pain - and that confuses us, stopping us from doing the things which give us the most value, joy, and positive identity.\n\n",

Now a days, it seems we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have bugs, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve wondered why. Now we have tickets which we get from our systems running in operations, but that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quite different. What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going on?\n\n",
