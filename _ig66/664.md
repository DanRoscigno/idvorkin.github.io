To celebrate Zach biking last week I promised root beer (Diet Of course!) And we had floats (with Diet Whipped Cream - Is that a thing).

Oh, Tori's been working lots so Zach has been cooking - this is worth watching:

Lastly, it's always important to remember life is finite, so I got this handy calendar. Too bad I'm too lazy to look at it - forget keep it up to date.

_ZiaT!_
