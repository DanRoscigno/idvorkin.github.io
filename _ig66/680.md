Wow, this was a packed week! I was a Chaperone at Camp Colemen for Amelia, I got my bike trailer so I can go Kayaking without fighting with parking, and I took a trip to Menlo Park where I gave an awesome presentation about AI. Zach had his first improv showcase and Tori's reputation proceeds her and she's getting asked to help out at other theaters!

Pulbic Serviec Announcement. Nothing is more important then kids events. Do what you need to so that you can attend them! This week was a great example! We had our quarterly get together in Menlo Park, but I was chaperoning Amelia's camp, so had to skip the first 3 days of that. Back to our story!
