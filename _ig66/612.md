Another quiet week. One more week till we're mask free and I'm stoked!

The highlight of the week for me is Amelia realized she can lock herself in my office and watch YouTube on the portal. To keep that on the down low, she "cleans my office". Pretty cute, and curious how she thinks my stuff should be laid out:

And, I also took the kids to cross roads, where we enjoyed dinner and some klesmer music.
