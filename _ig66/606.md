Last week I [talked about how hard reviews are](/ig66/605), and this week was an even longer, and even more emotionally draining week. Thursday I worked 14 hours from 5am to 7pm. As Tori says - "all plays open, and all plays close". Even though there is one more week till reviews are wrapped up, most of the work is done, all that's left is dotting the i's and crossing the t's. To toot my own horn, this year I had to write lots of reviews, and I did it a fantastic job. I had to write much more then I usually do, and I did it well with almost no procrasintating.

Because I was so focused on work, not much else happened. Though I have been biking to and from work, which is great!

Meta (where I work), has a very cool office, here's the sunrising, and our outdoor fireplace:

My newest habit is a daily selfie, and that's brilliant because it makes you find interesting things, and focus on others, and as a bonus you get some great memories. With the family:

And with some friends:
