"Igor, I was in Seattle the other day,  and I saw a meditaiton bench with your name on it". And so began my 30 minute a day meditation practice!  I'm on day 14, which means 7 hours of meditation!

**TODO: Add a picture of the meditation bench**

I've been trying to build a [meditation practice](/siy) for years, maybe even decades. I've come close, and at my best I've gotten upto 15 minutes a day.  In the last 14 days, getting in 30 minutes a day has been effortless. It's even cooler as my default schedule is now wake  up at 4:30, meditation for 30 minutes, then hit the gym for 5:30 work out for 2 hours, then hit the coffee shope for 30 minutes,  then at work by 8:30! Wow!!

The story of how I got here is a touch interesting ...

I met a new guy at work who was super solid, (and subconciously noticed he is super calm) and I noticed he'd posted something about meditation. I mentioned I was pretty interested in meditation and we setup a call to chat about it. He asked me what I was looking for, and I mentioned I have a coach in every aspect of my life, except for meditation, and maybe that's my problem. And that was that for a few weeks.

Two weeks later we had some missed connections where I was in California the week he was in Seattle.

When we got back from our trips he sent me a text, lets do a call. He said Igor you wouldn't believe it, I went to do my meidtation in in the office, and I saw a bench with a familiar naem on it, so I looked it up, sure enough it was yours.

He then offered to do a meditation course for me (basically a private class). I was naturally skeptical,  in fact I said. There are 3 outcomes:

> BTW, My math on this workshop thing, Worst case, burn 10 hours of forced thinking about meditation I don't enjoy.  Best case, get a practice I enjoy to do consistently. Middle ground, I get inspired, do something consistent for a few months,  and have a new arrow in my quiver

But conveniently he wasn't insulted and replied:

> My job is to help you hit scenarios 2 and 3

I've now picked up a life changing habit.




A huge thank you to Shikhar Dua for teaching me the SKY method

### Q&A

#### Do you recommend it?

Totally, nothing to lose, and so much to gain. That said I did the course with 1 other person, and he didn't enjoy it.

#### What is the method, what is different

The high order difference is it's eeffortless to do 30 minutes, and you feel super calm.

The method starts with various cyclic breathing exercises. I don't know the physics but there are a few nice properties:

* The cyclic breathing requires active attention at the start so your  atttention is stable.
* There are both long calming cycles and short hyper ventilating cycles, this contrast helps you go deeper
* Post technique,  you are super calm, and can stay there as long as you want


#### How will you merge this with your other meditation ideas?

Not sure yet, but this is a sound base, perhaps this is the warmup regardless of what I want to do.
