As a manager, the most intense thing I do is prepare for calibrations, that's when we represent the work the teams' we support have done, and ensure everyone is reviewed fairly. Even though I've done calibrations at 3 companies which have almost north of a 1 Trillion market cap for over a decade, I still take it incredibly seriously, and allocate a tonne of energy to it, and it's still seriously stressful for me.

So now, I can take a break from writing and relax:

One of the reasons I was less stressed, is I was hyper disciplined. I spent almost no time procrastinating, though the way I procrastinated was biking to and from work, and catching some sun rises.

A lot of this discipline (and extra energy) came from using my habits app. I added a habit to do magic, and take photos, which is awesome. I've done both more magic, and have some great photos! (I've also been getting up by 5am, and biking to work, and doing my gratefulness journal, and on some days even doing my meditation :) )

With Tori working, Zach's been cooking, which we always love. Zach's special this week was steak with fried onions - yum, yum, yum:

Oh, and since Tori is working in theater, we get some cool props at the house, for example:
