It's Jump in the Lake Day - that day we kick off the year by saying F@#\$ the resistance!! This year is all about being a class act, and this year that manifested by coming up with a Jump in the lake compromise. See, historically I plunged at a lake that was super crowded, meaning you'd have to get there early park really far away, and schlep to the beach. While I enjoyed this, the family was less enthusiastic since they were only there to support me. So this year, I decide to jump into a quiet lake where there was no parking and we could be done quickly!

See other days I did [this here](/ig66/603), and the first one [here](https://ig66.blogspot.com/2012/01/polar-bear-swim-thats-way-to-start-year.html)
Have a great year and remember: You might think it's cold and miserable, but that's just the [resistance](/resistance) you need persistence.
