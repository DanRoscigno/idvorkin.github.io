Today ends my 6-week summer vacation! We wrapped up the week with a fun family adventure in Victoria.

Foods of Victoria

- BC Ferry Poutine - The BC ferry system is pretty amazing. Gift shops, fantastic restaurants, great shoppping places before you get on the boat - oh my
- Peanut Butter Ramen - A bit of a surprise, we looked up the best ramen in Victoria, then we waited in line for an hour, and finally, we got the Ramen named after the restaurant. I probably should have read more about the reviews, as it was peanut butter flavored ramen. Tasty, but weird.
- Quebec Special Dipped Cone - Serendipitous because I wasn't planning to get one, but Amelia was getting gelato across the street, and the gelato place was empty, but across was packed. And it was a "Famous" dipped cone place from Quebec; this is the only store west of Ontario. (btw - I love dipped cones, and the only place I can normally get them is Dairy Queen, and when I go, it always feels like a walk of shame)
- High Tea - We went to a cheaper place than the Empress - fancy looking, but pretty meh.

Have a great week, and remember: _In Victoria's summer heat, we found delights so sweet to eat_ - ZiaT
