Dad how much will you bribe me to read this crap? 10\$ a habit, but you must finish in 2 weeks. Deal! I like to say 7 habits of highly effective people is my bible, and they have a teen version. For the low price of 70\$ I got Zach to read it, and that book, along with becoming VP of Tops has begun his journey as a highly effective teen!

### To file

- Calling Zach my 3 quarterling

### D and D

Ever since Zach's been a kid, he's always enjoyed being a story teller, and makign the rules that others followed.

This year, Zach got to do D&D class at school, and he did a D&D class with Tori.

He loves D&D, and is workign on his campaign for when he takes his next D&D game.

### School Politics - Zach the VP

### Biking, exercise and Diet

### Kayaking

On July 9th 2022 Zach was going stir crazy (the Wi-Fi was off) so I offered to take him Kayaking. With the choices of kayaking or stairing at the wall he chose Kayking. Zach not only enjoyed it, but he had a real knack of it. So we went Kayking again, and he was like a fish to water ( maybe a viking to a row boat?). So we bought a crappy inflatable boat, and we went, and went, so then we bought a better one, and a better one. Now Zach's always on the water.

We go in a tandem boat, and Zach doesn't want me to paddle, so I just sit in the back getting to talk to one of my favorite of people on earth. As we paddle about, Dad's on passing boats always scream out "Hey Kid, your dad is a dead beat, he's just sitting there while you do all the work", I always smile and wave. With Zach's sense of humor, I imagine he'll start yelling back "If you think that's bad, he doesn't pay his alimony either". Luckily, he's still a touch shy with strangers.

I'm getting comfortable to have Zach take his friends out too, and he went kayaking with Kai! I'm not comfortable to not be in a chase boat though, so I'm getting another boat to follow.

On a particularly awesome day, Zach decided we'd do a Kayak picnick. He packed awesome sandwiches into our Kayak cooler (Yes, of course i have lots of Kayak accoutraments"), and we headed down to SLU to launch. We paddled to gas works, and pulled our boat out and reached for our sandwiches. I looked back at that point, and realize we'd "surfaced" right in front of a nice couples romantic dinner. Well, I guess lesson learned, don't have dates in front of the dock.

### Self fullfilling prophecies vs chosing our own desitny

Zach went to Kindergarden at a Waldorf school (outdoor hippy school). We had a lot of respect for the teacher who told us "For some kids, their body brings them a lot of pleasure, Zach not as much". I accepted that as fact, and maybe that influenced Zach. I accepted it as I had a similar experience as a kid. But, in the last few months Zach has chosen to shrug off this self limiting script, and has begun writing his own positive scripts. He's starting the journey of physical health - building his muscles through kayking, his endurance through biking, and improving his health through diet.

Fantastic work Zach, and if I think about myself, when I've been in bad shape my body brought me little pleasure, but as I get into great shape, my body is starting to bring me pleasure, and more and more pleasure as I get stronger and healthier.

I'll tell you, the journey is a lot of work: diet, strength, endurance is hard, but it's worth it. Oh, and some more advice, it's very easy to fall off the path, and lose your way, but don't worry when ever you choose to get back on the path, you always can. And on the path, or off the path, you've got our full support.

Something you may not know - When you were born I was in terrible shape. I realized if I continued I wouldn't be able to enjoy you (and 4 years later your sister) and so I got into the best shape of my life. In the last few years my healthiness has really declined again, and I decided to push hard to get healthy again. This time, I'm focued on enjoying you, but also setting a good example in hopes I might motivate you.

Have a great day and remember: _When your kid becomes an effective teen, you want to voice "I'M SO PROUD OF YOU" in a scream_ - ZiaT
