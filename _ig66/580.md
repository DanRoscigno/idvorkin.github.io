I like to say kids are like hard drugs, they ruin your life but the highs are worth it. Jokes aside, Amelia's father day gift is gonna be in the top lifetime highs. I'm pretty sure no matter what is bothering me, this video will ground me, and make me feel fantastic.

**TODO:** Add photo of page Amelia is reading.

Have a great week, and remember _Being a father is awesome_ -- ZiaT!
