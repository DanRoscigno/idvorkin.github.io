After 14 months of isolation, as 70% of Seattlites have their first vaccine shot, the CDC declared fully vaccinated people can stop wearing masks! I jumped at the opportunity to meet Johnny, someone I've worked with very closely, but never met in person. We decided to go the park, and given my new found freedom, I dusted off my haven't used them in 16 months juggling clubs, my barely touched in 5 month magic fanny pack, and pedaled off!

Gas works, my favorite park, was glorious! Tight rope walkers balanced, acro yogaists balanced, an MC put on a mini concert for the park! There was even a pot bellied pig enjoying the socially gathered people looking to give him a pet. Arriving before Johnny, I basked in the sun while practicing my juggling. Making my day, a fellow came over to watch, and I gave him a quick juggling lesson!

When Johnny arrived, I was struck by a realization "Johnny, the back of your head! That's the first back of a head I've seen from a Facebook employee". As we chuckled, Johnny cocked his head, noticed a big group of people looking out over the water. "Isn't that our designer he asked me?" I was like, "uhh, no idea, all I can see is the back of them". Turns out it was not only our designer, but our whole design team - they were out celebrating their freedom!

It was serendipitous, so cool to meet some of my co-workers in person, to juggle, and even perform some magic.

_(Aside: The reason I stopped juggling fire was the torches burn with kerosene. While the flames are whipping by my face, I'm getting a lot of fumes, and I think that's pretty close to sniffing gasoline. Luckily, a gift of Corona Virus, I've got some super effective masks to protect me from the fumes -- so torch on baby!!)_

I've got several blog entries on the way, but here's a preview:

Back yard things like our fire pit, the hybrid power (gas and electric) hot tub and the fish (more on this later).

Have a great week, and remember _Corona Virus is at an end; We can our full lives attend!_ -- ZiaT!
