    "excerpt": "Great wolf lodge is this really cool water park resort an hour and a half south of us. We went for a day and spent a bunch of time in the pool! Zach kept doing the big water slide and wanted me to go, but I was a bit afraid. I really enjoyed the wave pool, I've never been in one before. Trust be told, this was the first time I'd even done a small water slide ant it was kind of scary. Kai, Ciel and Brian joined us. Sadly, they didn't Miga was sick, so she couldn't come. It was super fun.  ",

Tori is going insane as I've purchased over 10 (maybe even 15) fanny packs. It's been a tough journey, I've often thought I had the perfect fanny pack, but then the quality would be bad, or the material would rip, or the pockets would be wrong. But, now I think I have a great fanny pack, except for the color. Tori tells me if I don't buy another fanny pack for 3 weeks, she'll help me decorate this one! Fingers crossed.  ",

For example, I dressed up in a lama suit and took Amelia to sushi. At sushi she used chop sticks (super cool). I also rode her on an electric bike while wearing a lama suit which got many smiles and waves of appreciation. I think screaming like we were on a roller coaster helped too. Did I mention I got a super cool jacket, and the neighbor kittens come into our home and lick our plates? Yeah, they do.  ",

A great thing about taking the family to the subway is it gives us a chance to hang out without hurry or distractions. For example, last night we took 30 no pressure minutes to our destination - frozen yogurt, where we hung out and ate a taste desert before turning around and repeating the process. Because there's no hurry or distraction, we can talk and listen to each other.  ",

Like all relationships, it started with courtship and dating, but after a while, I got caught up in the hustle and bustle of life - especially work and child rearing. I started forgetting how much I enjoyed Tori’s company. Our early relationship wasn’t fireworks, nor daring high energy activities, but instead calm low key adventures where we relaxed and comfortably enjoyed simpler things.  ",

While the delays we had were avoidable, there is some silver lining to this experiance - which my dear son I want you to burn into the back of your head when you read this :). First always listen to your wife, she's right. Second, don't take for granted the things you have. Simple things life a roof over your head and heat coming out your vents bring you great pleasure.

With our bellies full, we headed to the museum. My poor planning failed to notice that the museum was closed on Mondays, so we were sad. Mulled wine with rum (something we'll have to investigate for our next party) took the edge off as we searched for the next museum. We got distracted by a search for Frank Gehry's whale and then a epic journey to find the remains of the Berlin wall drained our resources. We needed to re-charge and a meat sandwich hit the spot. Next we quested for the German parliament and lego land. A few shots with me and a giraffe later, and it was time for coffee and apple strudel. I'm told for apple strudel in Berlin there is only one choice - Einsteins, and I have to agree.",

Who would build a second largest tower you ask? Well, it turns out the tallest tower was the Moscow TV tower,and communist pride wouldn't allow you to build a tower bigger than the one in the mother land. To understand the second funny thing about the tower you need to understand that Russia doesn't believe in religion, so it is constantly tearing down religious artifacts like crosses. Well it turns out when the sun reflects on the disco ball in the TV tower, it forms a giant cross made of reflecting sunlight - this is what Berliners call the Pope's revenge :)  ",
