NOTE: Never let the truth get in the way of a good story. This merry cast represents the folks in the cave, with composite characters who weren't really there. For folks that were there, I'm sure you can figure out who you were and see the extra drama I've added to make the story more exciting.

Our cast of charectors:

- Brianna, Our heroine, an incredibly feirce young lady.
- Wyatt, Her incredibly supportive boy friend, helping keep our heroine calm and supported
- Tessa, A super hero who got me out of the cave, through her super calm blue energy, clear thinking, and grit.

"Chaperones, you've got your first aid kits, spare batteries, lights gloves, and emergency food. Grab 7 kids, do the final safety check - Boots, Gloves, head lamps, full water bottle, wait 10 minutes after the group in front of you goes in, and then go". I was chaperoning a 7th grade school trip to the ape caves. Super cool, and designed to be one of those magical experiences the kids remember about middle school for the rest of your life.

"What the hell are you doing?" a parent, seeing that I was wearing my Crocs, looked at me in disgust. "You can't wear sandals into the Ape Cave! Maybe you don't care if you break your ankles, you can be a dumbass, but what an irresponsible example for the 7th graders - get your shit together." Running back to my car to change footwear, I was the last parent in line. My first lucky break.

Let's talk about the Ape Cave. Pitch black, 2 miles long, 40 degrees regardless of the outside air temperature (that's 4 degrees for my Celsius-speaking Canadian friends), with lots of scrambles and sometimes rope climbs.

My second lucky break: at the back of the parent line, only 2 7th graders left - Beth, who I'd soon find out was a fierce, incredibly brave young lady, and Wyatt, her "boyfriend."

"Backpacks, batteries, lights, food - okay, do up your backups, be good to go." Gear inspection complete, we started in the cave. The kids were awesome, bouncing around and loving the scrambles. I took the back and let them lead. We took several chances to turn off our lights to enjoy the pitch black. In case you've forgotten, in 7th grade, a "boyfriend" is someone you need to have your besties call every few weeks to make sure you're still 'going out.' After our fourth time turning off our lights, when I turned them back on, Wyatt and Beth were holding hands - so sweet, I thought.

After several hard scrambles and an unclear amount of time, Wyatt and Beth were rushing ahead. "Slow down," I said, and in my head added, "You spend your life in the light, this is like the only 2 hours in your life where you can be in the pitch black and be present." But kids, what did they care? They kept scrambling, with me a few feet behind them.

The girl let out a little yelp, "Ow, I cut my ankle." "Stop, sit down, let me look." Barely any blood. "You want a band-aid?" I asked. "Nah, we're good," she said bravely. She got up, another yelp. "Meh, she'll walk it off in a minute," I thought. But then she started crying.

Sheesh I sighed in my head, a little girl, over reacting. We loooked at her ankle again, a light strain. After a few minutes Beth sucked up her tears and was like OK, lets go. One hop, one step, and a scream of pain. OK, lets sit back down I said.

As a chaperone I was equipped with an Ace bandage, but my only "training" was a spotty recollection of an ankle getting sprained and wrapped on TV. I did a pretty shitty wrap, but shouldn't matter, I was wrapping up her confidence more then the ankle. Wyatt came of too, helping keep her calm, and encouraging her that she'd be OK.

Ankle wrapped, we waited a few minutes, put your arm around my shoulder I said, lets hop. She was small, maybe 4 foot 6, so I was too high for her to get her weight on me, and she didn't want to lean on some random stranger, her foot touched the ground, another yelp, tears again. Hymn... OK, may be we have a real sprain here, damn wish I knew how to wrap her ankle better. o problem, I can carry her.

I wasn't sure how far in we were but very rough going behind us, didn't want to do that again, so forward we're do. Oh boy, was I was wrong.

Beth was light, and wasn't putting weight on my shoulder. I've been training for a while, so I just scooped her up in a front carry and started walking. After 5 minutes, my back getting a bit sore from the forward weight, we hit a stretch of 6 inches of water in the middle of the cave. There were dry scrambles on the sides, but I couldn't use my hands as they were holding Beth so we went through the water, soaked feet as the water flooded my boots. Beth super sweet, "Oh my god, let me hop", you can't go through a swimming pool. I laughed out loud, "Really a swimming pool? Have you ever been in a pool it's only 2 inches of water"

5 more minutes of front carry and we heard the group in front of us, but couldn't see them in the dark- "Hold up", let us get through this is hard, they yelled from in front. It took maybe 5 minutes, but I was tired, so felt like a break. Beth was upset now, we were holidng up another group. "Wanna see a magic trick" I said. "What?!", by the light of head lamps, I did a magic trick. Yeah, that's my super power I said, as she tucked the card into her pocket, she'll probably keep that for a while.

Finally the group ahead of us was clear. (Add Beth trying to hop again), Sigh, I just picked her up. Not being able to use my hands through the scramble, but luckily I'd been training, one legged squats, so it was kind of fun.

When we got the place the group ahead of us had taken a long time, I was like oh shit. Sheer face 8 foot climb you were supopsed to climb up on a rope, but the rope was totally frayed, so you needed to scamble. Now, I knew why the group ahead of us took so long.

No hands, I couldn't get her up, and no way she could get up. I sat down, and thought I'd wait for someone behind us that knew what tey were doing to bail us out. There was a really adept teacher behind us, he'd help us up he'd know what to do I'd just wait for him.

Another group came of kids came up from behind us. At this point Beth was Calm (maybe that magic trick worked), but now she kept worring about inconvenincing me and the others. Relax I said, this is way more fun for me, "I sit for a living, 45 hours a week,for the last 23 years. Most fun I've had for ever". We let the grouop pass us, Some kids got up quick, but the "indoor kids", took longer, it was hard maybe 5 minuttes.

And now the best luck I had that day. "Need a hand?", from the darkness, a dim round light, a Woman's voice. She'd heard we were hurt and came to find us.

"Nah" I responded, we'll just wait for the super teacher taking up th back of the line - "No you won't" Tara told me, "he's not coming", (That's worth another story later). Recalling what the super teacher said earlier to the kids - Look if things go wrong, if they're not prepared, that's life, you need to make it work. And it's gonna not go your way, you're heere to leaern you can make it work. OK, I thoguth, I can make this work.

for whom I am eternally grateful as otherwise me, Beth and Wyatt would still be in that cave.

At this point another Mom Tara, appearedd

The Mom's knew what they were doing, and they were like, OK, one can push, one can pull. You push she told me, starting to think for the first time, I'm like, Hymn, I'm probably stronger, maybe I should get up, and pull. Good idea she said, and got the girl up with only a few screams of pain.

The mom scrambeled up behind us, and was like, oh I'll carry the girl for a bit.

A funny aside: Morning workout

Because I was going camping myself, I could bring what I wanted, which including a skipping rope and kettlebells. See I've decidd I want to have the strangest lookking workout there is. It's called Kettle bells, and I started doing 1 armed swings (video), and Turkish Getups, and even upside turkish getups (video).

About 3 months ago, I watched a video that said, when you're old, if you fall, you break your hip, and your odds of dying within the year shoots up like crazy. Thinking about it, I realized I could build my fall resistance by skipping on one leg in a circle. So every day, optimizing to look silly, I start hopping on my left foot, a revolution of the clock clockwise, and then the counterclockwise. And then I switch to my right foot, and do it again. Turns out, that gives you bullet proof ankles.

Any who that morning, I woke up, and did my one legged skiipping rope, and then I did my swings, and TGUs. But, I only brought my adjustable kettle bells, which max out below my working weight. After doing my light weights, I grumbled i didn't get enough of a workout, so did some extra rounds, and was like, whatever, next time I'll bring heavier bells, and I did it on an uneven surface, so good enough alright.

On my ride to the cave, I was complaining to the folks about this, that I didn't get enough of a workout. They rolled their eyes, but being polite, kept their mouths shut.

Turns out good life choices.

3 years ago, with the help of the pandemic, I was in the wrosts shape of my life. On top of being old, and at my global weight maximum (230), I was incredibly inactive, and my quad would seize, and I'd collapse, unable to walk more then 20 minutes at a time. I found an amazign Physio Therapist, that rebuilt my ability to walk, and started to help me to fix my many physical problems.
