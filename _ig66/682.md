Lets talk about ape cave is a big deal, it's 2 miles long, pitch black, with lots of scrambles, lifts, and sometimes rope climbs. Being cocky, I was going to do it in my crocks, but then decided that's a bad example for the kids, so wore my hiking boots instead (Aside, probably the last time I did a hhard hike in those boots was 14 years ago when I did that cave at 29).

A few lucky breaks before we began.

Before we went in a small crew of 3 kids asked me if I'd be their chaperone. A small 13 year old girl, her boyfriend (aside: 7th grade "micro romance" is super cute), and the boys best friend. When it was time to go into the cave, the instructions were grab 7 kids and go. We were the last group, so we had the remaining 3 kids.

As we started in the cave, the kids were awesome, bouncing around, and loving the scrambles. I took the back and let them lead, and took several rounds turning off our lights to enjoyt he pitch back. A cave is kind of tricky, you can't see where you are, it's pitch black, and hard to know where you are.

After an unclear amount of time, the girl let out a little yelp, and said she twisted her ankle, and needed to sit down. I figured she'd walk it off, but then she started crying. Sheesh I thought, she's just a little girl, probably over reacting. We loooked at her ankle, no cuts. I figured this was more mentla then physical, and she sucked up her tears and was like OK, lets go. One hop, one step, and a scream of pain. OK, sit back down. As a chaperone I was equipped with an Ace bandage, but my only "training" was a spotty recollection of an ankle getting sprained and wrapped on TV. I did a pretty shitty wrap, but shouldn't matter, I was wrapping up her confidence more then the ankle.

Ankle wrapped, waited a few minutes, put your arm around my shoulder, lets hop. She was small, maybe 4 foot 6, so I was too high for her to get her weight on me, and she didn't want to lean on some randm stranger, she touced her foot to the ground, another yelp, now tears again. Hymn... OK, this might be a problem. No problem, I can carry her.

OK forward or head back, I wasn't sure how far we were in, but seemed like a while so I decide to go forwars

She was light, I scooped her up in a front rack carry. We start walking. Ugh, 4 inches of water on the floor, some ways around, but rock scrambles, and I've got aheavy load in my arm putting strain on my back. Better go throught he water. The girl, sweet was like Oh my god, I'm making you go through a swimming pool. Hah, I laughed, really this a swimming pool I said? Have you ever been in a swimming pool. We laughed a bit and continued. A small rock scramble, recall, my carry position as well as being tiring, didn't allow me to use my hands to scramble.

We got thorugha few sections, and then we had a problem. Sheer face 8 foot climb,, and the rope that should have been there was frayed, and didn't look like it'd work.

Oh yeah, that front carry, I'm getting pretty tired.

At this point, there was agroup in front of us, trying to get up that climb. It was slow, some folks were taking like 5 minutes to get up, it was ackward, some pushing, some pulling but they got up then our turn. OK, this climb was not possible.

Keeping the girl calm from being injured wasn't a problem, but she kept worring about inconvenince us, relax I said, this is way mor efun for me, I sit for al iving, 50 hours a week,for the last 23 years. Most ufn I've had for ever. We let another grouop pass us, Some kids got up quick, but the "indoor kids", took longer, it was hard maybe 5 minuttes.

OK, I thought there was a really adept teacher behind us, he'd help us up I'd just ait for him. At this point some other parents heard we were hurt, and so

A funny aside: Morning workout

Because I was going camping myself, I could bring what I wanted, which including a skipping rope and kettlebells. See I've decidd I want to have the strangest lookking workout there is. It's called Kettle bells, and I started doing 1 armed swings (video), and Turkish Getups, and even upside turkish getups (video).

About 3 months ago, I watched a video that said, when you're old, if you fall, you break your hip, and your odds of dying within the year shoots up like crazy. Thinking about it, I realized I could build my fall resistance by skipping on one leg in a circle. So every day, optimizing to look silly, I start hopping on my left foot, a revolution of the clock clockwise, and then the counterclockwise. And then I switch to my right foot, and do it again. Turns out, that gives you bullet proof ankles.

Any who that morning, I woke up, and did my one legged skiipping rope, and then I did my swings, and TGUs. But, I only brought my adjustable kettle bells, which max out below my working weight. After doing my light weights, I grumbled i didn't get enough of a workout, so did some extra rounds, and was like, whatever, next time I'll bring heavier bells, and I did it on an uneven surface, so good enough alright.

On my ride to the cave, I was complaining to the folks about this, that I didn't get enough of a workout. They rolled their eyes, but being polite, kept their mouths shut.

Turns out good life choices.

3 years ago, with the help of the pandemic, I was in the wrosts shape of my life. On top of being old, and at my global weight maximum (230), I was incredibly inactive, and my quad would seize, and I'd collapse, unable to walk more then 20 minutes at a time. I found an amazign Physio Therapist, that rebuilt my ability to walk, and started to help me to fix my many physical problems.
