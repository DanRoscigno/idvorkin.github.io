"Chaperones, you've got your first aid kits, spare headlamps, and emergency food. Grab 7 kids, do their final gear check, then wait 10 minutes after the group in front of you goes in - then go." I was chaperoning Zach's 7th-grade caving trip. The trip is designed to be one of those magical experiences the kids remember for the rest of their lives - I know I will.

A wise man once told me: Never let the truth get in the way of a good story. This telling adds drama and excitement. The cast are composite characters who weren't really there. For folks that were there, you'll know who you, and the truth, always remember your help fine day.

My first lucky break came 10 minutes earlier - "What the hell are you doing?" said a veteran chaperone, looking at my brightly colored mismatched Crocs with disgust. "You can't wear sandals into the Ape Cave! Maybe you don't care if you break your ankles. Maybe you don't care if you're a dumbass, but don't be an irresponsible example for the 7th graders - get your shit together."

Let's talk about the Ape Cave. Pitch black, 2 miles long, 40 degrees regardless of the outside air temperature (that's 4 degrees for my Celsius-speaking Canadian friends), carved by a lava flow 2000 years ago, with lots of scrambles and an 8-foot lava waterfall. It's hard to describe, so I pulled some pictures off of Flickr to give some sense of it (these are random people I don't know - todo look for my old photos).

My second lucky break: Running back to my car to change into hiking boots, I ended up at the back of the parent line. When it was my turn, there were only 2 7th graders left - Beth, who I'd soon find out was a fierce, incredibly brave young lady, and Wyatt, her "boyfriend."

"Helmets, batteries, lights, food - you two are ready - zip up your backpacks. Let's go!" The kids' gear inspection complete, we started in the cave. Beth and Wyatt were awesome, super excited to be in this dark amazing cave.

{%include bi_table.html is="rock-feild.jpg; rough.jpg; scramble.jpg;" %}

The cave starts with a really big scramble - think climbing over a rock avalanche. Wyatt, from natural fearlessness or maybe trying to impress his young lady friend, tried to get ahead, and I yelled at him to stay back with me. Beth, more cautious, wasn't sure where to step, was probably working through some well-deserved fear. To make sure she had a good experience, I went a few feet in front of her, showed her where to step, and called out places where rocks were loose and good handholds. Even though I was looking ahead, I was listening carefully. She'd freeze every few steps, and I'd say, "You good?", to make sure she was. "Yup," she'd answer and keep going. Getting into a groove, I stopped paying attention and lost my footing. "You good?" Beth asked me, "Yup," I chuckled, being impressed by how this 13-year-old was keeping tabs on the person who was supposed to make sure she was safe.

After a lot of scrambles, they were getting comfortable, so I moved behind and let them lead. When you turn off the lights, it's pitch black, so we turned off our lights to enjoy the experience. In case you've forgotten, in 7th grade, a "boyfriend" is someone you need to have your bestie call every few weeks to make sure you're still 'going out.' After our second time turning our lights on and off, Wyatt and Beth were holding hands - so sweet, I thought.

It's hard to tell time in a dark, cold cave. More time, more scrambles, now Wyatt and Beth were rushing ahead. "Slow down," I said calmly, and in my head continued, "You spend your life in the light, this is the only 2 hours you'll be in the pitch black." But what do 13-year-olds care? They kept scrambling, with me a few feet behind them.

Beth let out a little yelp, "Ow, I cut my ankle." "Stop, sit down, let me look." Barely any blood. "You want a band-aid?" I asked. "Nah, I'm good," she said bravely. She got up, touched her foot to the ground, another yelp. "Meh, she'll walk it off in a minute," I thought. But then she started crying.

Sheesh, I sighed in my head, a little girl overreacting. We looked at her ankle again, maybe a light strain. After a few minutes, Beth sucked up her tears and was like, "OK, let's go." One hop, one step, and a scream of pain. "OK, let's sit back down," I said.

As a chaperone, I was equipped with an Ace bandage, but the only "training" I'd had in using one was a spotty recollection of an ankle getting sprained and wrapped on TV. I did a pretty shitty ankle wrap, but it shouldn't matter. I was wrapping up her confidence more than the ankle. Wyatt was a godsend here as his caring was keeping Beth calm and encouraging her that she'd be OK.

Ankle wrapped, we waited a few minutes. "Put your arm around my shoulder," I said, "let's hop." She was small, maybe 4 foot 6, so I was too high for her to get her weight on me, and she probably didn't want to lean on some random stranger. Her foot touched the ground, another yelp, tears again. Hmmm, OK, maybe we have a real sprain here. Damn, wish I knew how to wrap her ankle better.

I wasn't sure how far into the cave we were, but I knew we had very rough going behind us, and I didn't want to do that again, so forward we go. (Consulting a map, after the fact, that was a bad idea, we weren't even halfway through).

Beth was light and wouldn't put her weight on me. I've been training for a while, so I just scooped her up in a front carry and started walking. After 5 minutes, my back was getting unhappy from the forward weight. The next stretch of cave had 6 inches of water through the middle of the cave. There were dry scrambles on the sides, but I couldn't use my hands as they were holding Beth, so we went through the water, my socks squished as the water flooded my boots. Beth, super sweet, "Oh my god, let me hop, you can't go through a swimming pool." I laughed out loud, "Really, a swimming pool? Have you ever been in a pool? It's only 2 inches of water."

5 more minutes of front carry and we heard the group in front of us, but couldn't see them in the dark. "Hold up, let us get through. This is hard," they yelled from in front. It took them 5 minutes to clear, but I was tired, so a break felt great. Beth was upset now, we were holding up another group. "Wanna see a magic trick?" I said. "What?!" I could see her disbelief in the glow of my headlamp. By the light of headlamps, magic trick done, she tucked the card with her name on it into her pocket.

Finally, the group ahead of us had cleared. (Add Beth trying to hop again.) Sigh, I just picked her up. Not being able to use my hands through the scramble, but luckily I'd been training one-legged squats, so it was kind of fun.

We got to the place the group ahead of us had taken a long time. I could see why. 8-foot sheer rock face (it's called a lava fall, think waterfall but made of Lava), 8-foot climb you were supposed to do with the aid of a rope, but the rope was totally frayed, so it wasn't safe to use.

No hands, I couldn't get her up, and no way she could get up. I sat Beth down and joined her. Hmmm, no problem, I'd wait for the teacher at the back of the pack that knew what they were doing to bail me out.

Another group of kids came up from behind us. At this point, Beth was calm (maybe that magic trick worked), but now she kept worrying about inconveniencing me and the others. "Relax," I said, "this is way more fun for me. I sit for a living, 45 hours a week, for the last 23 years. Most fun I've had forever." We let the group pass us. Some kids got up quick, but the "indoor kids" took longer. It was hard, maybe 5 minutes.

And now the best luck I had that day. "Hey, I'm Tessa. Need a hand?" From the darkness, a dim round light, a woman's voice. She'd heard we had an injury and she came to find us.

"Nah," I responded, "we'll just wait for the super teacher taking up the back of the line." "No, you won't," Tessa told me, "he's not coming." (That's worth another story later). Recalling what the super teacher said earlier to the kids - Look if things go wrong, that's called life, you need to make it work. I thought for 20 seconds, got up, and accepted Tessa's helping hand. Tessa, if you're reading this, I am eternally grateful for your help. Without you, I'd likely have required just as much rescuing as Beth.

Tessa knew what she was doing. Looking at the lava fall, she said, "OK, one of us can push her up, the other can pull her over. You push," she told me, starting to think for the first time, "I'm like, Hmmm, I'm probably stronger, maybe I should get up and pull." "Good idea," she said, and with her pushing and my pulling, we got Beth up with only a few screams of pain.

Tessa was good. She found some foot and handholds in the lava fall and got up quickly. Getting a good look at me, she said, "You're tired. Give me Beth. I'll carry her for a turn." I was confused. Tessa was strong, but awfully small. There was no way she could carry Beth. Well, no way she could carry Beth in that dumb macho way I was doing it. She gave Beth a piggyback ride. "OMG - I thought," I need to start thinking.

That night, as always, I was in bed by 8 p.m., in my tent with my light off, I heard Beth's voice - "Your dad is pretty cool," "Yeah, he does magic too," Zach replied. "I know," she said while patting her pants pocket. "My dad does balloons too, but they make a real mess." And with that, a giant smile on my face, I fell asleep, completely satisfied.

Our cast of charectors:

- Beth, Our heroine, an incredibly feirce young lady.
- Wyatt, Her incredibly supportive boy friend, helping keep our heroine calm and supported
- Tessa, A super hero who got me out of the cave, through her super calm blue energy, clear thinking, and grit.
- Norman, A teacher that helped on the way down

### A funny aside: Morning workout

Because I was going camping myself, I could bring what I wanted, which including a skipping rope and kettlebells. See I've decidd I want to have the strangest lookking workout there is. It's called Kettle bells, and I started doing 1 armed swings (video), and Turkish Getups, and even upside turkish getups (video).

About 3 months ago, I watched a video that said, when you're old, if you fall, you break your hip, and your odds of dying within the year shoots up like crazy. Thinking about it, I realized I could build my fall resistance by skipping on one leg in a circle. So every day, optimizing to look silly, I start hopping on my left foot, a revolution of the clock clockwise, and then the counterclockwise. And then I switch to my right foot, and do it again. Turns out, that gives you bullet proof ankles.

Any who that morning, I woke up, and did my one legged skiipping rope, and then I did my swings, and TGUs. But, I only brought my adjustable kettle bells, which max out below my working weight. After doing my light weights, I grumbled i didn't get enough of a workout, so did some extra rounds, and was like, whatever, next time I'll bring heavier bells, and I did it on an uneven surface, so good enough alright.

On my ride to the cave, I was complaining to the folks about this, that I didn't get enough of a workout. They rolled their eyes, but being polite, kept their mouths shut.

Turns out good life choices.

3 years ago, with the help of the pandemic, I was in the wrosts shape of my life. On top of being old, and at my global weight maximum (230), I was incredibly inactive, and my quad would seize, and I'd collapse, unable to walk more then 20 minutes at a time. I found an amazign Physio Therapist, that rebuilt my ability to walk, and started to help me to fix my many physical problems.

Special Thanks to Tristan my trainer, and Lynelle my physiotherapist who transformed me from a 230 lbs man who collapsed when walking as little as 9 minutes into the person I am today.
