"Dad - it's not virtual camping, you just turned off the Wi-Fi" said Amelia in protest. And she's right! We were originally going to go real camping, but I got my tooth pulled, so wanted to stay home in case there were complications. Turns out many of us had WiFi withdrawl, but once we over came that, was awesome to get out and adventure, and adventure we did. Biking, Kayaking, Beaching, Bubbling.

Why?

- Seattle is amazing, our location is amazing. Bike, hike, paddle, downtown, restaurants, within 5 miles
- Cant do it since sucked into wifi, need to be bored
- Turn off the wifi.

Amelia

- Went swimming (donut)
- Backyard to make smores in our gas firepit
- TBD: Went biking
- TBD: Brought a friend camping

Zach

- Struggled with withdrawl
- Made the case that we were actually going glamping and as a result we'd have brought our laptop
- Downloaded lots of contnet
- Once got out of withdrawl, decided that hed make a movie.
- Come on, let me write or make a movie, that's production not consumption.
- Got on his bike, first time in a year, maybe in 3.
- Rode the bigger bike like a champ
- Volunteered to go the beach, had a great time, and convinced Tori to join us (which was easy since there was parking)

Tooth

- Lots of mental trauma, but it's done, next up get an implant and move on (but slow process)

Igor

- Biked around, people loved the bubbles
- Made hot dogs camp fire food.
- Figured out how to paddle and park at u of w
- Focus on compassion, altruistic joy and loving kindness.
- Got up and did a morning workout with the sunrise and pullups
- Encouraged all the activiites
- Running out of energy by the end

Custom Bubble machine

- Problem #1 attaching to bike

  - Tori made a custom holder to hold and ratchet to bike and remove

- Problem #2 - Portal, and Powerful.

  - Tried all USB powered bubble machines on AMZN
  - USB bubble machine with high power, bought like 4.
  - Only 10 w
  - Big USB battery

- Problem #3 - All the bubble juice sloshing out

  - 2 water bottle holders, Carry bubble juice concentrate
  - 3D printed for more capacity and mostly cover
  - 3D print leaks, cover in tape
  - Make a funnle whole with stopper

- Problem #4 - Froth making bubbles useless

  - Add baffles
  - Try using bubble anti frothing

- Problem #5 - Bubble machine melting
  - Likely a function of the type of plastic used. Will try another.

Park and Yoga workout

- Wake up at 4:30, so if I get up early, that's 3:30
- Went to the park at 4:30 to enjoy the sunrise and do my mobility and workout
- More fun than the gym, though less intense, and no cardio
- Can't do cardio since tooth extraction
- Bands, foam roller, and yoga
- Coffee shop, home by 8
- Not just wrote this, but did my magic routine, and happy to have all my chargers, and emergecy magic supplies as didn't bring my fanny pack.

Weight

- 199.2, next up, the line for overweigth which is 196.
- Yeah, I guess thatll be the next one.

- Biked Amelia there
- Didn't gorge, only added a 1 lbs (in bulk, not weight)
- Did balloons
- Ran Bubbles
- Did Magic - kids screaming with joy
- Tried riding a skateboard, took it easy.

Have a great year and remember:_Turn off the WiFi and your family will detoxify_ - ZiaT
