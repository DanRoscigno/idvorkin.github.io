"Dad - it's not virtual camping, you just turned off the Wi-Fi" said Amelia in protest. And she's right! We were originally going to go real camping, but I had some minor oral surgery, so wanted to stay home in case there were complications. But, I wanted the camping experience where we weren't distracted and did stuff together to avoid boredom. So - I decided virtual camping would be having the Wi-Fi off. Turns out, as expected, and including for the parents, WiFi withdrawl is real. Once we over came that, was awesome to get out and adventure, and adventure we did. Biking, Kayaking, Beaching, Zooing, Bubbling.

Why?

- Seattle is amazing, our location is amazing. Bike, hike, paddle, downtown, restaurants, within 5 miles
- But can't do it if you're stuck on Wi-Fi
- SO ... Turn off the wifi ... Let the stir crazy kick in ... and then enjoy the amazing city.

Amelia

- Went swimming (donut)
- Backyard to make smores in our gas firepit
- Went biking
- Brought a friend camping, went to the zoo, and swimming, even Zach and Tori came to the beach the second itme.

Zach

- Struggled with withdrawl
- Made the case that we were actually going glamping and as a result we'd have brought our laptop
- Downloaded lots of contnet
- Once got out of withdrawl, decided that hed make a movie.
- Come on, let me write or make a movie, that's production not consumption.
- Got on his bike, first time in a year, maybe in 3.
- Rode the bigger bike like a champ
- Volunteered to go the beach, had a great time, and convinced Tori to join us (which was easy since there was parking)
- Went Kayaking, and did Amazing.

Oral Surgery

- Lots of mental trauma, but it's done, next up get an implant and move on (but slow process)
- Very worried there was a remaining root tip. Since my endontist told me that was the reason I needed the extraction. Oral Surgeon was like no it's not the case, I was on laughing gas so was like "look, I'm not gonna argue right now", then next day said need you to talk to endontist to make me feel safe. They talked, he was like no it's fine, but to be a 100% sure come in and get an xrary.
- Came in, and he was like, ok you being paranoid made me paranoid. Everything is fine. See you in a few months for the implant.

Igor

- Biked around, people loved the bubbles
- Made hot dogs camp fire food.
- Figured out how to paddle and park at u of w
- Focus on compassion, altruistic joy and loving kindness.
- Got up and did a morning workout with the sunrise and pullups
- Encouraged all the activiites
- Running out of energy by the end

Park and Yoga workout

- Wake up at 4:30, so if I get up early, that's 3:30
- Went to the park at 4:30 to enjoy the sunrise and do my mobility and workout
- More fun than the gym, though less intense, and no cardio
- Can't do cardio since tooth extraction
- Bands, foam roller, and yoga
- Coffee shop, home by 8
- Not just wrote this, but did my magic routine, and happy to have all my chargers, and emergecy magic supplies as didn't bring my fanny pack.

Weight

- 199.2, next up, the line for overweigth which is 196.

### July the 4th

Slightly crowded out by virtual camping, but an archive worthy experience no less! We were invited to a 4th of July party and really enjoyed it.

First, Ammon wanted to make cakes, but is also dieting so he made a cake and brought it over. He also brought cake lollipops as they are awesome. We took them to our 4th of July party everyone loved them:

- Of, course didn't make it to fireworks, good thing as I go to bed at 8
- Biked Amelia there
- Didn't gorge, only added a 1 lbs (in bulk, not weight)
- Did balloons
- Ran Bubble Machine
- Did Magic - kids screaming with joy
- Tried riding a skateboard, didn't go so well.
