This week Zach took a stay at home cooking class. It was really neat, every morning they delivered the ingredients, and then every afternoon they turned Zach into a Chef. And then every evening they turned our kitchen table into a gourmet restaurant.

Our menu for the week:

- Monday - Morracon
- Tuesday - Sushi
- Wenesday - Salmon
- Thursday - Italian Alfredo
- Friday - Steak o' Poivre

This list doesn't do it justice because every mail had a main, a wonderful side with a wonderful sauce and a wonderful desert.

We ate great, and Zach was so proud of his work, and well deserved. It was great.

Have a great week, and remember _Zach is an amazing chef, puts my diet in distress_-- ZiaT!
