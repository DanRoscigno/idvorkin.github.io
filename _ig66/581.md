This week Zach took a stay at home cooking class. It was really neat, every morning they delivered the ingredients, and then every afternoon they turned Zach into a Chef. And then every evening they turned our kitchen table into a gourmet restaurant.

Our menu for the week (foolishly I didn't take pictures of all the meals, but you can get a sample):

- Monday - Moroccan

- Tuesday - Sushi

- Wednesday - Salmon
- Thursday - Italian Alfredo

{%include bi_table.html is="pasta.jpeg;salad.jpeg" %}

- Friday - Steak o' Poivre

This list doesn't do it justice because every meal had a main, a wonderful side with a wonderful sauce and a wonderful desert.

We ate great, and Zach was so proud of his work, and well deserved. It was great.

Have a great week, and remember _Zach is an amazing chef, puts my diet in distress_-- ZiaT!
