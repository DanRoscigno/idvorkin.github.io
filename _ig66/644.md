Amelia - Dad, I'm always having such bad luck, every time something terrible happens .... We've been doing lots of camping this year, which has been fun, but Amelia's right she has had some bad luck. Thankfully she's super resiliant, and gets back up on the horse.

- Dad - stop helping, I need to learn to do this otherwise what am I gonna do when I grow up
- Kayaking whuile camping
- Having the kids help to setup and tear down
- Bikign at the camp sites

### Vault Toilets

### River Current
