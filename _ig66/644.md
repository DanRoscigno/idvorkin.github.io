### Vault Toilets

"Tori, can you check on Amelia, she went to the bathroom a long time ago", "She's fine you always tell me to stop worrying" ... 5 minutes later ... "It's been a really long time, please go"... "Sigh, fine"

Aside, I don't think of myself as fancy, but my ass does enjoy flush toilets. Normally we only camp places with flush toilets, but this campsite that was close to Seattle so we made an exception ... Now back to our story ...

Fifteen minutes earlier, Amelia went to the bathroom, which was a dark, only a little bit stinky vault toilet. While some vault toilets are new, this one was pretty old and the door was sticky. Needing privacy, Amelia had to pull on the door really hard to get it to close properly. Amelia notes it was dark, but luckily her eyes adjusted so she could see.

Remember that sticky door? Well that became a problem 2 minutes earlier when Amelia tried to leave the bathroom, but the door would not open. Try as she might, at 8 years old there's only so hard Amelia could push, and it wasn't enough to get the door open.

After pushing and pushing unsuccessfully, Amelia tried screaming for help, but no one came, so she kept screaming. After 5 minutes Amelia figured no one was going to come, and she better save her voice until she heard someone coming by.

Amelia realized she was stuck, and started going crazy and crying. Even though only 8, Amelia is fierce and use to hard situations. With tears in her dark adjusted eyes she looked for what she could do to escape. She saw a vent grate and realized it was small, but so was she, and if she could only get the vent off she could be free. She started to pull on the grates, 1 bar 2 bars, 3 bars. She was very excited, but then as she got the next vent out she didn't see sunshine, she saw wood, the vent didn't go outside it just went to a chimney.

Luckily at this point, Amelia heard Mom's voice "Amelia ..., Amelia ...", and thankfully Amelia had saved her voice so screamed out "Mom!", Tori came and rescued her.

As a testament to Amelia's braveness, even though she was crying all the way back to the campsite, and then in the tent for a while, she still goes into vault toilets, but now she know she just needs to really push her shoulder into the door.
