I love being spontaneous. Thankfully so does Zach. So today at 5pm, (we were gonna leave at 4, but Tori was making a tasty dinner), we jumped in the Tesla with a sleeping pad and a sleeping bag and drove out to a campsite. Slept in the Tesla, then came back at 6am, to get Zach back to school for picture day. Perfection!

Here are some photos to remember it by - though I hope this is the first trip of many:

Oh and look how handsome Zach is in his shirt and tie

And here's a contribution from GPT-o!

- From dinner at four, Tori's tasty delight,
- To sleeping 'neath stars, what a night!

- In a Tesla so sleek, we did drive,
- At five, oh what a time to arrive!

- With a pad and a bag, we did sleep,
- In a campsite, our adventure to keep.

- Zach was the star, picture day was near,
- With a shirt and a tie, oh so dear!

- Photos to cherish, memories to make,
- This trip's the first, but more we'll undertake.
