All summer Zach's been fantisizing over a train adventure, and all my time in Seattle I've been fantasizing about going to Portland. On Friday when Zach suggested we could do a train trip to Portland, I was like, OK lets do it. Sunday day Trip!

The train is slow, but it's about the journey not the destination. The train was pretty empty so we had lots of room to stretch out:

The coolest thing we did in portland was check out the museum of science. Due to Corona Virus much of it was closed, but amazingly the museum has a real submarine, and amazingly it was open! So cool to get on a submarine!

Oh yeah, while I'm a big fan of fanny packs, I realized I can go bigger, and tried a hip pack. More room then I needed but it passed the travel test.

Have a great week, and remember - It's about the journey not the destination, so see you at the train station - Ziat!
