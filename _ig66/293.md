I'm incredibly proud to say I'm under 150 lbs, for the first time since I was 14. I've been able to accomplish this using my [1000\$/month weight pledge](https://ighealth.blogspot.com/2013/12/the-best-1000-i-never-spent.html) for 25 months in a row.

As I reflect over my success to date I ponder 3 questions:

- 1. Why was this successful, and how can I replicate it in other endeavors?
- 2. What is my plan for sustainability?
- 3. What is my target weight?

Why this was successful and how to replicate it will be fleshed out in a future blog post.

Sustainability will be tied to my analysis above. Sneak peak: I keep doing this for the rest of my life.

My target weight is 140 lbs. Calling my target weight 140 lbs is a bit misleading, because when I weight in at 140 lbs, my "fighting weight" is closer to 160 lbs. For me, 160 lbs is a "normal weight" using the BMI calculations, and 160 lbs is when I look great, using a mirror.
