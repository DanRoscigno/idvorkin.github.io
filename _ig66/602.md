Zong! It's like Pong, but Zach made it! For the past few weeks Zach has been taking an interactive programming course. Today, on Christmas Eve 2021, Zach finished the first major project - writing Zong (aka Pong bit the ball has a big Z on it :) ) ! I'm so proud of Zach, not only did he write the game, but he's been doing 2-4 hours a week of programming, and much of it with me. It's a pleasure to be a part of this.

_(I didn't notice until I took this photo, but the whole time we've been writing Zong, the TV behind Zach has had a AIs playing a pong like game)_

You can play Zong on a laptop by going [here](https://py3.codeskulptor.org/#user306_xRyyWRzdMJRWxln.py), and then clicking the run button, and then be sure to press inside the window that comes up for the keys to be registered.

For me, Zach programming brings incredible joy - seeing Zach flourish, knowing Zach can have a great career, and being able to have an activity with infinite depth with Zach. I've always romanticized how a blacksmith's son becomes a blacksmith.

With this project I experience it deeply. There is such a craft, and so many potholes, and rabbit holes you can hit while programming. Because I'm with Zach while he's programming, I can share my insights. Not just out errors that I see that are obvious (missing a ',' or wrong braces, or mismatched XYZ), but when to stop and write out what you're thinking.

If you're for a beginner programmer course, I highly recommend [Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/interactive-python-1)

Some of the fun challenges we worked through (and thinking about our Industry's solutions):

- Off by one errors
- Typos as a result of static typing
- Duplicate code
- Confusion of using Tuples instead of classes
- Separation of concerns
- Different input models.

And for my programmer friends here's the code:
