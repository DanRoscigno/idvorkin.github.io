Well just when you thought COVID was over, Igor got COVID. And then Zach got COVID. So far the ladies haven't got COVID, but who knows. This was bad timing since it was spring break. Luckily I was better early enough to still go to Great Wolf Lodge (Greg was there too), and managed to get a trip to the zoo.

During Covid, many things stopped, and now that it's over, it's time for all those things to restart. Diet, exercise, magic, weird keyboards ... it's time!

Most importantly diet - I really let my weight go during covid, and now it's time to get it back. Luckily I have slews of experience dieting, I have lots of big tupper wares to fill with arugula, and most important I have some very important reasons to be dieting!

We also dropped a lot of activities we enjoy. Luckily, it's super easy to get them back, zoo membership - check! (And yeah, that's a peacock with me and Amelia)

Something that didn't really stop during the pandemic, but is fun regardless, is date nights, and exploring weird keyboards

And another thing that didn't stop is how great Amelia (and Zach) are. Here's Amelia and her new arctic wolf Arielle

Have a great year and remember:\_Have a kid? Give 'em COVID- ZiaT
