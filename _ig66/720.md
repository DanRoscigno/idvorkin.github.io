A few random blessings and some photos I've had over the weeks. Of course, the biggest blessing is having an amazing family - but there's some fun stuff that happens too.

**Blessing 1:** I was walking with Zach in a rather hilly park, and I saw a young lady in a wheelchair who was having some trouble getting up the hill. I asked her if I could give her a hand, rather embarrassed, she acknowledged yes, and I did. Not sure why, but felt like a bit of a mitzvah to be able to do that:

**Blessing 2:** An older (homeless/possibly high) man on a bicycle with a feather in his cap went by. I hollered - love the feather. He circled back around, and asked for money. I didn't have any. Then he looked at me with a huge smile and said can I rub your head - of course I said and he did, then biked off with a huge smile.
