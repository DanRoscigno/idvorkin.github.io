During Covid, many things stopped, and now that it's over, it's time for all those things to restart. Diet, exercise, magic, weird keyboards ... it's time!

Most importantly diet - I really let my weight go during covid, and now it's time to get it back. Luckily I have slews of experience dieting, I have lots of big tupper wares to fill with arugula, and most important I have some very important reasons to be dieting!

We also dropped a lot of activities we enjoy. Luckily, it's super easy to get them back, zoo membership - check! (And yeah, that's a peacock with me and Amelia)

Something that didn't really stop during the pandemic, but is fun regardless, is date nights, and exploring weird keyboards

And another thing that didn't stop is how great Amelia (and Zach) are. Here's Amelia and her new arctic wolf Arielle
