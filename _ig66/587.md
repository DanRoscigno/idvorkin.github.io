We went for a date

What does AMelia want to be when she grows up

- Vet
- Dr or Nurse
- Pshychatrist

I was gonna go to bed driving with Zach and Mom, but then they started talking about her dad, so I started to eve's drop. I could close my eyes and imagine what was going on.

What do you imagine my work is like?

There's a desk, and chair
And you sitting there typing
And maybe there's a coffee machine?

Lets take the subway, cuz we haven't much
Thai Thom For Dinner (Amelia Noodle)
Cool windows on the Subway Station

Since it was a date, we went for desert, but couldn't find anything so had to eat icecream.
Which we were excited for, but then we realized they just had weird stuff like "tea ice cream" and "coffee icecream", - Who in the world likes that.

Luckily they had a bearable choice - chocolate, which was OK.

Then we took the subway home.
Beuiful pictures at night of the bridge
Amelia took lots of the pictures

Oh yeah, Boys:

Igor: Remember when you get a boyfriend, I'm going to get a shotgun and beat him up.
Amelia: Dad - You shouldn't do that, cuz if you do, I'll move it.

Later ...

Amelia: Mail rhymes with Tail
Igor: Do you know there are different kinds of mail?
Amelia: Yup, like mailbox, and mail like ...
Amelia: The guys you threatened with a shotgun.

Finish with Amerlia reading me a bed time story.

Amelia, how does your tablet have no timelimit?
Well, I'm pretty smart and guessed the password
