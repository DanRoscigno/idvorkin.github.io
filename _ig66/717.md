"I ask you a question. When your answer makes no sense, I ask you more questions". It was a dark and stormy night, and the candian border agent was not happy with my answer. 2 minutes earlier Border Gaurd: "Why are you coming to Canada?" Igor: "To go the yellow Deli!" Gaurd: "What, you drove 3 hours for a sandwhich?" Igor: "6 hours we're coming back tonight. But. Yes, it's run by a jewish cult!". ... After many questions concerning gun ownership, switchblades, and unsavory charectors the guard let us pass. On the way back, having experienced the yellow deli, I was filled with conviction on how great the trip was, and we skipped the harassment

This was part of the my 2024 winter break:

Add content:

- Magic Ticket
- Atomoshere
- Sleeping in the back of the Tesla
- 6 hours talking about tonnes of topics like

**Have a great day and remember:**

Over the hump with reviews we hop, Crossing t's with workouts non-stop.

Goals in mind, sunrises and fun intertwined.
