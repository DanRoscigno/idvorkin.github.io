I'm over the hump on performance reviews. We're still doing them every morning till Thursday, but the hard stuff is all done and now it's crossing the t's, dotting the i's, and finishing the paperwork. All that is to say this week's energy was all spent on performance reviews, but next week should be a more interesting week.

Even though I was devoting most of my energy to work, I did get in some great workouts, caught a sunrise, saw the Miga's, and goofed off a bit with Amela and Zach.

I also spent some time thinking about [goals for the year](/y24). Always easier to think about goals than to actually do them, but hey, gotta start somewhere!

**Have a great day and remember:**

Over the hump with reviews we hop, Crossing t's with workouts non-stop.

Goals in mind, sunrises and fun intertwined.
