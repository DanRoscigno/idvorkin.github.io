I'll skip the excuses for the past few missed blog posts. I've got a bunch of backlogged content that I'll bash out so I'm ready to go for the halloween 2022 post. One huge milestone this week, I finally crossed 50lbs off my waist line (180lbs from 230 at the start of the year!)

### Zach ...

Broke his arm 3 weeks ago, but it has been healing and now he's out of his sling!   Zach always a joker liked to say:

"I'm so funny I broke my humorous(upper arm bone)"

After almost a year of trying to shoo Zach out of the living room lazy boy chair (sitting in the matching lazy boy chair is kind of my kryptonite) Zach has migrated to my office, and now lives in here almost permanantly watching youtube, gaming, running D&D campaings and working!

In fact, I tried to ask Zach to help co-write this blog post, but he tells me has been procrastinating his school project and as a result has to hustle to get it done. Pretty amazing actually - we're feet apart with our headphones, listening to our youtube music, creating in our ways... Woah kid awesome seeing you grow up.

Zach's really into D&D, he loves being a dungeon master and has been trying to organize his friends into a virtual game - though organizing a bunch of 12 year olds to play 3 hour D&D campaigns is tough, but he's gotten a few games together already

### Amelia ...

Amelia is at a sleep over this weekend, which is awesome as she was having some trouble with sleep overs earlier, glad she's over it! Amelia also has an amazing halloween costume, and she's started making youtube movies (just like the rest of the family, well except for Tori):

Her channel is [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUmXIPM9XtmEQKUg48D_ecg) and one of her first videos, it's possible I'm one of the characters but I'm not so sure...

### Igor ...

Health wise, I hit a weight milestone, I'm 180lbs, that's down 50 lbs since the start of the year! WOW! I'm also looking to get into kettlebells. As such, I did my first 100 kettlebell swings in 10 minutes, then did 10 turkish get ups, then 3 rounds of deficit pushups and assissted pullups, all in under an hour! If you don't know what kettlebells are, they're like a rock with a handle. Exactly what you'd expect russians to use to workout. I don't have a photo of me doing kettlebells, but here's me doing pullups.

(I'm not taking these videos because I'm vain (though I can be), it turns out when I do pull ups I tend to pull harder with my right shoulder (resulting in bicep tendiniotous) so I take videos to make sure I'm pulling evenly)
