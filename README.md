## Key user features

### Permalinks

### Table of Contents

### Back Links

### Search

### No broken links

### Keyboard features

- ? - See help while in a post
- t - Toggle Toc

### Comments

Not yet implemented, however a few things I tried that I disliked:

- Disquis
- Gitter
- hackmd

Something that seems good (for developers), is direct linking to the page on github master so you can comment. However this [isn't supported](https://github.com/isaacs/github/issues/284)

## Key authoring features

### Markdown baed edditing and version control

A jekyll blog stored in markdown

### Permalinks

Standard markdown feature

### Table of Contents

### Back Links

### Search

Uses algolia:

- bi.sh - Build index for algolia search

### No broken links

### Keyboard shortcuts

### Useful scripts

- js.sh - Run the development server with live reload and excluding spurious jekyll warnings
- prettier - Opinionated consistent formatting, auto run on git commit
- vim-toc-generator - Auto generate TOCs, auto run on save
- checklinks.sh- Check for [broken links](https://github.com/idvorkin/LinqPadSnippets/blob/master/python/checklinks.sh) - Runs manaully from other repro

### Re-writing from scratch
