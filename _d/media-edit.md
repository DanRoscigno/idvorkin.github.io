Lets play with media editting. So far I've liked luma fusion for post:

## Text based media editting

- Loom lets you do this, it shows the words, and then you can trim the video using the words. Given everyone has great transcription now this will get much easier. Though maybe even easier with shotcut like tools.

## Luma Fusion

### Keyboard shortcuts

- Split - M-B

## Screen casting tools

Keyboard Capture - Keycastr
Mouse Capture - hyper mouse
