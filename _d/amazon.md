## The Good

### Day 1 culture

### Embracing change

### Resourcefulness

Frugality, done correclty is resourcefulness. It says, if you need 10 people, have 8, and you'll do better work. If you have 12 people, you'll start making up work, and bad stuff happens.

### Frupidity

Frugality, done correclty is resourcefulness. It says, if you need 10 people, have 8, and you'll do better work.

Some people used frugality to focus on not the high order bit. For example, I had a frequent battle to over hardware which cost less then 15\$/month.

## Leadership Principles (LPs): The beating hart of Amazon.

At Amazon training the first thing they tell you is "Everywhere else, you see the leadership principles on the wall, and no one knows what they are", at Amazon, they are no on the walls, but instead we speak to them every day.

You don't just speak to them daily, you speak to the leadership principles multiple times a day.

### Design principles for Leadership

### The dirty secret of LPs - You can justify anything.

If you think of LPs as a "vector space", you can use them to justify any behavior or action as a leadership principle.

Humorously, each LP has an opposite cancelling force.

| LP              | How to refute with an LP                                                                             |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Bias for action | You are not thinking big enough. You are not customer obsessed, you need to insist on high standards |
|                 |                                                                                                      |
