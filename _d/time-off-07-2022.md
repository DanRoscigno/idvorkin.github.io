title: Time off July 2022 - FISM and Canada.
---

It's FISM (olympics of magic), and I'm going to Quebec city to reenergize my love of magic, since I'm already in Canada I'll also spend time with My Mom, Sister, and college room mate.

This is a combination of [time off](/time-off), and all the stuff for [happiness](/happy), which I guess gets tangled up with half of my evergreen notes.

## My top priorities

- Keep my weight at 200 lbs (though dropping 5 extra would be amazing
- Maintaining my mobilily, and cardio routine (can skip strength)
- Maintaining my emotional health habits
- Get my Mom setup with fresh electronics
- Minimize Procrastination
- Disconnect from work as soon as I'm done work.

### Stock market being down impacting my ability to spend

Even with a down market, I've still got lots of savings, and a fantastic job, and certainly deserve to enjoy myself.

### Missing root from tooth extraction

I just got a tooth extracton and am concerned about root removal, following up with Oral Surgean and endontist before I go, and deciding I'll trust their answer

### No buffer between vacation and work

To preserve time-off with the family. I'm working the first few days of my canada trip. While the flexibility is great, I wonder if I'll have trouble disconnecting, and would be better off using some of that time to do initial decompression.

I guess if I do, I can take the time off.
