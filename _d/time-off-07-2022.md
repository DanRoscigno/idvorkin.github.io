title: Time off July 2022 - FISM and Canada.
---

It's FISM (olympics of magic), and I'm going to Quebec city to reenergize my love of magic, since I'm already in Canada I'll also spend time with My Mom, Sister, and college room mate.

This is a combination of [time off](/time-off), and all the stuff for [happiness](/happy), which I guess gets tangled up with half of my evergreen notes.

## My top priorities

### Maintain Healthy habits

- Keep my weight at 200 lbs (though dropping 5 extra would be amazing
- Maintaining my mobilily, and cardio routine (can skip strength)
- Maintaining my emotional health habits
- Minimize Procrastination
- Disconnect from work as soon as I'm done work.

### Other

- Get my Mom setup with fresh electronics
- Enjoy the magic
- Feel got the most out of vacation

## Executive Summary

## Moments

## Success Stories

## Top Learnings

- **GET A GYM MEMBERSHIP** - Gym is a fantastic place to focus on strength and renewal and anchor the day. I got a gym membereship with GoodLife, let me do my top pirorities daily, even had a massage chair.
- **Don't berate mistakes** - Getting off the plane, it was super bright in torontoo. I opened my sunglasses case, and turns out I brought a second pair of glasses. OMG, I'll be blind, this will be terrible. Meh, was on the beach 20 hours over the weekend, was fine, turns out I hav ean abilityt o squint. Nothing terrible happens.
- **Continuous learning** - Any structural solutions - apply to next time (like having this list)
- **Stop panicking and think** - Turns out my friend was flying into Toronto, so got him to bbring my sunglasses.
- **Don't catasrophize** - On the flight down realized I didn't bring the credit card on which I booked the car, and need to use for insurance. Thought would need it to checkout car. Freaked out a bit, got there - turns out it was totally fine
- **Don't fret micro optimizations** - From Belleville to Hamilonton, spent lots of time trying to figure out what time I'd adrive, what order of gym/work/sister/luncch I'd tackle, trying to micro optimize, spent lots of cycles. Turned out, didn't matter at all.

### Stock market being down impacting my ability to spend

Even with a down market, I've still got lots of savings, and a fantastic job, and certainly deserve to enjoy myself.

### Missing root from tooth extraction

I just got a tooth extracton and am concerned about root removal, following up with Oral Surgean and endontist before I go, and deciding I'll trust their answer

### No buffer between vacation and work

To preserve time-off with the family. I'm working the first few days of my canada trip. While the flexibility is great, I wonder if I'll have trouble disconnecting, and would be better off using some of that time to do initial decompression.

I guess if I do, I can take the time off.
