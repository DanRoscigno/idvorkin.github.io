## Philosophy

### The value of art - inspiration

### Augmented Intelligence

We can have text to speech (TTS) with any voice, perhaps a famous voice saying something will inspire you:

### Word to Image Generator: DALL-E and Stable Diffusion

- [Dall-E is OpenAI's Image Generator](https://openai.com/blog/dall-e/) the examples lower in the blog post have some level of interaction.

Run stable diffusion on M1 mac (WOW!!) - <https://github.com/brycedrennan/imaginAIry>
