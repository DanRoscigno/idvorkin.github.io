## Philosophy

### The value of art - inspiration

### Augmented Intelligence

We often need inspiration.

### Creativity

### Emotional Impact

### Surprise

## Tech

### TTS (Text to Speech) Read the content back with a different voice.

We can have text to speech (TTS) with any voice, perhaps a famous voice saying something will inspire you:

### Lipsync a video/audio

### NLP: GPT-3

So much to say about about GPT, should be in [NLP](/nlp)

### Face Generator

### Image to Word Generation

### Not a real face

These use GAN to create not real faces - crazy how real they look.
