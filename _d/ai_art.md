## Philosophy

### The value of art - inspiration

### Augmented Intelligence

We often need inspiration.

### Creativity

### Emotional Impact

### Surprise

## Tech

### TTS (Text to Speech) Read the content back with a different voice.

We can have text to speech (TTS) with any voice, perhaps a famous voice saying something will inspire you:

### Lipsync a video/audio

### NLP: GPT-3

### Face Generator

### Image to Word Generation

[Dall-E is Open GPT's](https://openai.com/blog/dall-e/) thing, and the examples lower in the blog post have some level of interaction.

Much better is this Russian variant ([see gallery](with a live demo (annoying need to translate to Russian first):

### Not a real face

These use GAN to create not real faces - crazy how real they look.
