"That is Pride Fucking With You" is the only scene I can quote from any movie. It's a powerful scene, and critical message.

Take a moment and watch the scene, I'll wait:

Decisions are hard "period". Add pride to the mix, and the odds that you'll make the right decision drops to near zero. If you're mixing pride and decisions STOP and read [decisive](/decisive).

Judge Yourself
Cognitive Distortions - Someone cares about you.


# Goeth before the pride
* Pride goeth before the fall
* Triumph - Roman empower has someone whispering in their ear
* An emporer Triumph has a slave whispering in [his ear](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-historical-evidence-of-the-story-about-the-slave-named-Auriga-who-was-whispering-Memento-Mori-to-the-military-commanders-during-Roman-triumphs)

# Situations where Pride Impacted me
* Not willing to apologize
* Being Right vs Being Effective
* Promotion more important then pay
* Title


# Comparing yourself to others

Friends who's careers accelerated beyond mine.



# Promotion for title vs compensation or anything else.

# Need to be acknowledged by others

# Judge yourself
