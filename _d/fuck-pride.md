"That is Pride Fucking With You" is the only scene I can quote from any movie. It's a powerful scene, and the advice is timeless. Two thousand years ago when a Roman emperor had a victory parade, he was required to have a slave standing behind him whispering continuously: "You are mortal. You are mortal". Pride and ego are seriuos foes that must be kept in check.

**Step 1:** Watch the scene from pulp fiction, it's fantastic cinematography and a critical message:

**Step 2:**  Imagine being the Roman emporer, focus on what that slave is telling you - "You are mortal, you are mortal"

Hopefully all this talk about pride prepared you for the thing I want you to know:

**Decisions are hard "period"** Add pride to the mix, and the odds that you'll make the right decision drops to near zero. If you're mixing pride and decisions read [decisive](/decisive).

*I'm not sure how best to write this post, so as you have ideas - share them. For now, I think the best approach is sharing times when Pride fucked with me, the consequences, and the antidote.*

#### Judging my career relative to my peers.

**Antitdote:**  Don't compare yourself to others, compare to what you want.

I was an intern at Microsoft in 2001. I started my career at Microsoft with Sally (not her real name), a fellow intern and a very good friend. Our careers tracked closely till he became a principal development manager, and then went to Amazon. Sally and I went for beers every few months, and as my career grew linearly, hers grew exponentially.  In our January beer she was a QA team, by March she was taking over a team in India, and by September, she had an organization of 50.

Meanwhile, my team was still only 10 people, and I felt like a failure.  Feeling like a failure sucks, so I didn't really want to go for beer anymore. But then one day, while talking to my mentor, it clicked. I shouldn't evaluate myself relative to Sally's life. I should evaluate myself relative to what matters to me.


#### Feeling cheated that I was not evaluated fairly by my management.

**Antitdote:**  Don't let your friend/boss/society's assessment of you outweight your own.

Here I was lucky, I was able to learn from a mentor. My management mentor, Beth, was someone who I  respected so much I joined her team to get "my PhD in management". This manager was a huge role model, but he was essentially pushed out of his organization. I remember asking him, wait if you're so good at why you do, why is it that these guys pushed you out.  His answer is burned into my mind:

> Everyone will judge you, and that's OK, but the judgement you need to apply is your own principles. In this case, if I were to burn in hell for my actions, I'd have been happy with that. I looked deep into my soul and know I did the right thing.

*An important aside here: It's easy to be wrong on A) your principles, and B) your assessment of said principles. Be sure to test them with multiple trusted advisors and folks you respect who have gone through a similar situtation*

#### Being right mattering more then being effective
**Antitdote:**  Ask yourself if your desire to be right exceeds your need to be effective. Don't lie, don't comprimise your ethics or responsibilties, but be flexible in what you accept and you might find there's a solution where being effective can even be compatible with being right.

TBD

*The rest of this post is just very rough notes*



Accept Reality
Judge Yourself
Cognitive Distortions - Someone cares about you.
Only switch jobs if you're willing to take a pay cut.

Situations where Pride Impacted me
####  Not willing to apologize
#### Being Right vs Being Effective
#### Promotion more important then pay
#### Job Title vs responsiblity

#### Promotion for title vs compensation or anything else.

#### Need to be acknowledged by others

#### Need to be praised by others
