Getting To Yes is the seminal book on negotiation. It's the deep dive into [win win or no deal](/win-win) and [seek first to understand](/first-understand). The formal, be hard on problems and soft on people, then focus on the desired outcomes not the positions, next get more options on the table, and make sure you measure by objective criteria - lastly know your BATNA.

### Hard on problems soft on people

Let [compassion](/compassion) be a guide.

_When someone throws a rock at you, you don't get mad at the rock, you get mad at the person. But no one wants to throw a rock at you, they likely did it due to their suffering. So, just as you don't get mad at the rock, don't get ad at the person, get mad at their suffering_

### Focus on outcomes not positions

### Brainstorm options

### Find objective criteria

### Know your BATNA

Best Alternative to Negotiated Agreement. Essentially what you get if you don't reach an agreement. If your BATNA exceeds what you'd get in the negotiation, you should walk away and take your BATNA. E.g.

Imagine you're negotiating with Jerry on selling a knife. If Jerry doesn't take the knife you can always sell the knife to Bob for 100$, so if Jerry gives you less then 100$, you can walk away and sell it to Jerry.
