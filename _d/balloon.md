How can you put a huge smile on someone's face with 10 cents of material and 20 seconds of work? Making balloons! In 2022 I discovered ballooning, and have used it to bring joy ever since.

### It's all about joy

Balloons are a fantastic vehicle for

### Amelia's Grade 3 holiday Party

Highlights:

*  Didn't get an invite, e-mailed teacher said I'm a professional clown, got me an invite
*  Deaf kid
    * Had an interpreter, who is probably a huge thing in the kids life.
    * Wanted a balloon, could see him asking interpreter, and interpreter saying wait to the back of the line.
    * Gave kid balloon
    * Kid's balloon unravelled. Saw kid asking interpreter to get a new one, interpreter said no.
    * I tried to get  kids attention to come to me and a get a new one. He wouldn't.
    * So I went to him with an awesome balloon
    * Later, kid started seeing other discarded balloons and picked them.
    * Eventually kid had like 10 balloons, and was so happy beaming.
    * He was like exploding with joy, and had a spontaneous giant hug for interpreter before leaving the room.
* Coming back to school after the party
    * Left school after party
    * Came back to pick up Amelia
    * Like 1 in 8 kids had balloons (recall, I did balloons for a full grade)
    * Kids so happy walking with parents
    * Best part, no one recognized me. I could just savor the moment of the joy everyone had.

### Some of my creations

### The Selflessness of Balloon teachers

* Most of the balloons I learned from youtube.
* Amazing that folks would just share the balloons for anyone to make


### Psychology of Balloons

#### Grown ups want balloons too, but are afraid to ask

* Most grown ups won't take a balloon, but if you say give it to your partner, they're really happy to, and their partner enjoys it.

#### Everyone is happy with their sword, until someone else gets a mega sword

* Life lesson here, happiness is a differential

#### We want to believe makes it so

* Kid says he wants X, I make a Y, then tell them it's really an X
* Kid feels he got a Y, checks for validatation from others
* Others, including me say no, it's an X,
* After kid negotiates with himself, and decides you're not lying, kid runs off happy.

### Impact vs Effort

### Ethical Considerations

#### Should I make guns?

Decided a water gun blaster is fine. I now make that. I also make a water gun blaster that shoots water.

#### But boys want guns, and girls want mermaids.
