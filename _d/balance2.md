I'm good at a lot of things, but balance is really hard for me. Hard for everyone I bet.

## Types of balance

### Golden Geese: Balancing Production and Production Capacity

As said in the [7 habits](/7h)

### Juggling Elephants: Balancing the roles in your life.

There are many roles in your life, and it's important to monitor and balance between them.

We often simplify our roles as work and life, (see: [I don't want to spend too much time at work](/wlb)), but there are many more. I use my [eulogy](/eulogy) to define my roles (and do some composition - E.g. Magic and tech gets their own category while biking is grouped into Hobbies)

### Productivity vs addiction and resistance.

## How to achieve

### Monitoring the roles in your life

In some roles, I default to over investing, for these **red is over investing**, green is just right, and blue is under investing

<div id="balance-heatmap-work"> </div>

For the other roles, in which I under invest, **red is under investing**, and **blue is over investing**, which as you see, doesn't happen that often ;)

<div id="balance-heatmap-rest"> </div>

A few notes:

- TODO: Need to make a better color mapping, default colors aren't matching the intent.

- I find a correlation between work being green and the rest being green. If work is over invested, everything else gets under invested.

- I find sometimes even when work is in balance, I spend too much time on a role, like tech, and not enough on the others. For me, it' usually family that suffers.

- The assessment here is a normalized 'actual investment vs desired investment' not 'time spent'. For me, I want to spend about an hour a day on magic, while 8 hours day on work.

- Desired time spent varies over time. For example, on holiday, my desire is to spend zero time on work.

### Focus on Impact, not energy spent

We should not measure the success in our roles by the energy we spend. For example, our role of healthy can likely be achieved with an hour a day, while work, likely requires many more hours then that.

### Parkinson's law and the 80/20 rule.

[Parkinson's law](/parkinson) tells us we'll spend as much time as we have available to us on a task.

The 80/20 rules says you get 80% of the value from 20% of the time.

### Peak end rule and moments

We remember an experience based on the average of the peak and the end. This is very important when it comes to time in relationships and energy spent. It does not matter how much time we spend together, but how we end it and the maximum pleasure.

This leads to a few best practices:

- [Creating moments](/moments) when planning your events.
- Think about the closing ceremony, make sure it's great.
- Quit while you're ahead - it's very easy to squeeze out a few more minutes, which makes for a miserable end, and ruins the experience.

This also has some consequences:

- Time together in the same room both doing separate activities is not helpful.
- The duration of the event does not matter.

### Activation Energy

Investing in a role requires activation. See [Activation Energy](/activation)

## More resources

Oddly, not a tonne of books on the topic. Juggling elephants is a fun parable style book on it.
