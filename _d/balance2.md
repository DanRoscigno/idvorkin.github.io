I'm good at a lot of things, but balance is really hard for me. Hard for everyone I bet.

### Effectivness the balance between Production vs Production Capacity

As said in the [7 habits](/7h)

### Wolk Life Balance

[I don't want to spend too much time at work](/wlb)

There are many roles in your life, it's important to monitor and balance between them. This chart represents desired energy allocation vs actual, with green being just right, and the other colors dependant on the type.

For work, red is **over** investing.

<div id="balance-heatmap-work"> </div>

For the other roles, **red is under investing**, and **blue is over investing**.

<div id="balance-heatmap-rest"> </div>

A few notes:

- TODO: Need to make a better color mapping, default colors aren't matching the intent.

- I find a correlation between work being green and the rest being green. If work is over invested, everything else gets under invested.

- I find sometimes even when work is in balance, I spend too much time on a role, like tech, and not enough on the others. For me, it' susually family that suffers.

- The assessment here is a normalized 'actual investment vs desired investment' not 'time spent'. For me, I want to spend about an hour a day on magic, while 8 hours day on work.

- Desired time spent varies over time. For example, on holiday, my desire is to spend zero time on work.
