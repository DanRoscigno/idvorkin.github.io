It's spring break 2024 and I've got a week off. The last few weeks have been a bit crazy at work trying to get some big features launched and into public testing, so very excited for the time off. I usually try to avoid too much tech, but I'm looking forward to making some tech investments as it's been a while.

I kind of miss doing lots of technical and blogging - so I'm looking forward to both of those.

I've got several headwinds going into this break:

- Money Troubles have been great - stock market is through the roof, with Meta and MSFT at all-time highs!
- Health has been great, diet, and exercise are dialed in.
- Even though I had three intense weeks at work, my co-workers are amazing, and everything is good.
- My "Dealer of Smiles and Wonder" Persona has re-emerged from Hibernation

All coins have two sides so Tailwinds as well:

- Weather is cool and rainy
- Tori is working
- Most of our friends are out of town

My top priorities:

- Spend time with family
- Stay healthy (though this is easier than usual see below)
