Bringing joy for others is my thing. From my eulogy - _Igor lived to see eyes go wide and mouths gape with wonder. Igor especially loved it when strangers got drawn in against their inner objections, or when a kid having a meltdown, or a grown up looking miserable, forgot their troubles._

## Completed Projects

### Magic

- Doing [magic for others](/magic)

Strait from my [eulogy](/eulogy):

_Making cards change colors at a spectators command or passing coins through a spectator's hand -- Igor lived to see eyes go wide and mouths gape with wonder. Igor especially loved it when strangers got drawn in against their inner objections, or when a kid having a meltdown, or a grown up looking miserable, forgot their troubles. Once Igor learned [magic](/magic), that consumed his free time and became his favorite tool._

## Theory

### Attributes of Joy

Joy is an involuntary experience that acts on you. You can be more receptive to joy, but even when you're not you can experience joy against your will.

Increasing the receptivity to Joy

TODO Use Lens of Self/Other/Process

### Safety the precondition for Joy

- Don't want to look stupid
  - Think about teenagers wanting to look cool
  - This is why sing in the shower
- Don't want to be ripped off
  - Is this a conn?
  - What's your angle for doing this?
- You can increase someones comfort by getting validation from others

  - Someone else doing it before you
  - Reassure person
  - Smile
  - Start with a small commitment

- Performers spend lots of time building the first follower
- The most important guy is [The First Follower](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=)
  {% include youtube.html src="fW8amMCVAJQ" %}

### Why kids are more receptive to Joy

- Thing are more novel
- Naturally feel safe
- Less need for validation of peers
- Except things to be wholesome and good

### Other things to file

- Concerts
- Figgie Pudding
- Christmas Carols
- Can't help yourself but to sing along

### Joy and Wonder

Some connection between joy and wonder
Some say when you clear your mind you feel joy (or bliss)

### Joy and Overwhelming kindness from a stranger.

If a stranger does something really kind for you unexpectantly, that's kind of like joy

### Joy versus pleasure

Pleasure is the release of tension. The going from anticipation of something positive to getting it. Eating chocolate cake, orgasm, getting to pee when you have to go. Eating a very tasty cake. Joy isn't like that.

### Things that bring most people joy

- Babies (especially smiling, or holding your finger)
- Baby Animals
- Bubbles
- Reacting to a smile
- Beautiful singing
- Singing out loud
- Christmas Carols
- Dancing
