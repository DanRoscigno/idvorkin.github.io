Bringing joy for others is my thing. From my eulogy - _Igor lived to see eyes go wide and mouths gape with wonder. Igor especially loved it when strangers got drawn in against their inner objections, or when a kid having a meltdown, or a grown up looking miserable, forgot their troubles._

- Baby Animals
- Bubbles

### Safety the precondition for Joy

- Don't want to look stupid
  - Think about teenagers wanting to look cool
  - This is why sing in the shower
- Don't want to be ripped off
  - Is this a conn?
  - What's your angle for doing this?
- You can increase someones comfort by getting validation from others

  - Someone else doing it before you
  - Reassure person
  - Smile
  - Start with a small commitment

- Performers spend lots of time building the first follower
- The most important guy is [The First Follower](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=)

Why kids are more receptive to Joy

TODO Concerts

### Joy versus pleasure

Pleasure is the release of tension. The going from anticipation of something positive to getting it. Orgasm, Getting to pee when you have to go. Eating a very tasty cake.

### The satisifaciton of bring joy to others

Right from my [eulogy](/eulogy):

_Making cards change colors at a spectators command or passing coins through a spectator's hand -- Igor lived to see eyes go wide and mouths gape with wonder. Igor especially loved it when strangers got drawn in against their inner objections, or when a kid having a meltdown, or a grown up looking miserable, forgot their troubles. Once Igor learned [magic](/magic), that consumed his free time and became his favorite tool._

Back in his 30s he used to juggle lots of things, the coolest of which being [juggle fire](http://ig66.blogspot.com/2014/08/accomplishment-unlocked-juggling-file.html?q=torches).
