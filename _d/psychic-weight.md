Imagine a weight tied around your body, imagine it dragging behind you, slowing down your motions, preventing you from going where you want to go. Imagine never taking it of, and getting now relief regardless of when you sit or sleep. Now imagine that's not a physical weight, but instead a mental weight, a psyhcic weight if you will. Psychic weight are the thoughts that prevent your mind and emotions from being fluid and light.

## Examples from my own life

### Bathroom remodel feeling "f@#\$" over

During our bathroom remodel, I felt the contractor was trying to f#\$ us over, and I got incredibly wroked up, I couldn't sleep for multiple days. Ultimetly, the contractor corrected the work, but me getting worked up, just made me a mess.

### Insecurity around money

I used to be very insecure about money, I couldn't buy a 1/2 gallon of milk because it was more expensive per ounce then buying a gallon of milk. And don't worry, this was happening well into the time I was buying 100\$ on my bar tabs.

### Needing to finish a self evaluation

### Needing to finish a document at work

### Small things that got really big

If you don't do small things, they get bigger and bigger and bigger.

### Examples of Pride
