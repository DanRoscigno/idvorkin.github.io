Let me ask an easy question: "How are you feeling?". How long did it take you to answer? Less then a second? Impressive. Now a harder question "What makes you say that?", or even harder "How do you 'compute' how are you feeling?" What is going on? Human's have a super fast heuristic called mood giving them an insant assessement of their sujective reality. Mood is critical to understand as it drives our behaviors, has an outsized influence on our subjective experience, can be in conflict to our pursuit of happiness, and most importantly has several bugs which can be exploited by the resistance and other bad actors.

## Why mood matters so much

### Our actions are heavily influenced by our mood

### Our subjective reality is heavily infuenced by our mood

### Good Mood does not equal the pursuit of happiness

See [Happy](/happy)

{%include summarize-page.html src="/happy" %}

### The heuristic is buggy

### The heuristic is bi-directional

## Theory and model

TODO: Move this to its own page

Reminder: Mood != Pursuit of happiness. Pursuit of Happiness is a process or a skill, we over focus on mood, and underfocus on PoH.

Mood is an in the moment evaluation of the quality of the present moment.

Mood = Heuristic Fast Assess(Quality of Present Reality)

**Why do we have mood?** Mood is a shortcut we use to know if things are going well. Without needing to spend brain power on evaluating the situation we can "know" if it's good. In general it works. Pain is bad, loved ones are good. But, the heuristic has bugs.

**Is it a one way street?** Interestingly it's bi-directional. The link between mood and the brainâ€™s assessment of the quality of the present is bidirectional. Smiling when in a bad mood makes you in a good mood.

**Is it balanced?** "Reality" can be formed Combiation(Self, Other, Process). Even if one of these components is good, you may over attribute to the others, and vice versa. For exampe, if you're in physical in pain, you'll perceive a relationship as worse then it is.

As a model,

| State   | Description                                                         |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Self    | My assessment of self                                               |
| Other   | My assessment of others (including inanimate objects like possions) |
| Process | My interactions with said objects                                   |

| State   | Past | Present | Future |
| ------- | ---- | ------- | ------ |
| Self    |      |         |        |
| Other   |      |         |        |
| Process |      |         |        |

### Quotes

In the original, it's about comfort, not pleasure.
