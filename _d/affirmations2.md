Every day I write out my affirmations. These are positive statements that help me challenge and overcome my self-sabotaging and negative thoughts. When I repeat them often, and believe in them, I make positive changes.

These are mine, you'll need to find yours. These weren't my original affirmations, they've evolved over time.

### Deliberate. Disciplined. Daily

- Discipline is [being proactive](7h-c1), it's the path to success.

- It's so easy to lose your discipline. But that's OK be [self compassionate](/compassion), and you can (and should) restart the next day.

### Know Essential. Provide Context

- There are so many choices, you need to choose, spend time finding [the essential](/essential) and [begin with the end in mind](/7h-c2).
- People have no idea what I'm talking about. Think about the story that will make it clear. Practice the story, refine it, till it lands.
- Find the essential, by [writing it out](/writing).

### First Understand. Appreciate. Be a class act

- People want to do their best and are rational. Seek [first to understand](/7h-c5), and only then be understood. This is also the core of [compassion](/compassion)
- It takes 7 times to hear something positive about ourselves to make up for 1 negative thought.

- Appreciation is also very important because all humans have [anxiety](/anxiety) and [impostor syndrome](/imposter)

### Be Present. This too shall pass

- Every day can be full of [joy](/joy), but if you're not paying attention you'll miss it. Being present will also let you [appreciate](/appreciate) others which also brings satisfaction.
- There is good, and bad. While we wish the bad will turn into good, we need to remember the good isn't permanent, it's just as transient.
