Every day I write out my affirmations. These are positive statements that help me challenge and overcome my self-sabotaging and negative thoughts. When I repeat them often, and believe in them, I make positive changes.

These are mine, you'll need to find yours. These weren't my original affirmations, they've evolved over time.

### Deliberate. Disciplined. Daily

Discipline is being proactive, it's the path to success.

It's so easy to lose your discipline. That's why you need to apply self compassion. As part of your compassion, don't feel bad, just restart the next day.

{%include summarize-page.html src="/compassion" %}

### Know Essential. Provide Context

There are so many choices, you need to choose, spend time finding the essential:

{%include summarize-page.html src="/essential" %}

As you do this, begin with the end in mind:

{%include summarize-page.html src="/7h-c2" %}

People have no idea what I'm talking about. Think about the story that will make it clear. Practice the story, refine it, , repeat till it lands. The best practice to achieve this is to write it out:

{%include summarize-page.html src="/writing" %}

### First Understand. Appreciate. Be a class act

People want to do their best and are rational. Seek first to understand, and only then be understood.

{%include summarize-page.html src="/7h-c5" %}

It takes 7 times to hear something positive about ourselves to make up for 1 negative thought.

{%include summarize-page.html src="/appreciate"%}

Appreciation is also very important because all humans have anxiety and impostor syndrome.

{%include summarize-page.html src="/anxiety" %}
{%include summarize-page.html src="/imposter" %}

Doing this will strengthen your compassion

{%include summarize-page.html src="/compassion" %}

And most importantly, turn you into a class act.

{%include summarize-page.html src="/class-act" %}

### Be Present. This too shall pass

Every day can be full of [joy](/joy), but if you're not paying attention you'll miss it. Being present will also let you [appreciate](/appreciate) others which also brings satisfaction.

{%include summarize-page.html src="/joy" %}

There is good, and bad. While we wish the bad will turn into good, we need to remember the good isn't permanent, it's just as transient.
