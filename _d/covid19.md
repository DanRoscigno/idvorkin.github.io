From James Altchur: Media companies make money scaring you. Politicians stay in office (or get office) by assuming the worst case and hoping for the best so they can say, "Look, we did everything we could."  So ignore that. Also ignore the market. As I said the other day, as long as it's going up or down 5-10% a day, don't invest. There will be opportunities later.  Is the market cheap? It sure is. \$5,000,000,000,000 in stimulus is going to hit the economy, which is already assuming a worst-case scenario Depression which is not going to happen.

## Circle of concern and circle of influence from a class act leader

Go watch how Bill Gates answers questions around how the goverment did nothing in February (the past is always outside the circle of influence). He ignores the bait on what we got wrong yesterday, and focuses on what we need to do today (core to the circle of influence) That's a class act leader:

- Interviewer: Trying to Stir a rage answer on why wasted on February
- Bill Gates: OK, we didn't act, but the good news is "focus on productive action"

## Unexpected Consequences

### Shortages caused by retail arbitrage.

I didn't realize this was a thing, but people buy stuff locally (often at thrift stores and garage sales and discount) and then sell it on Amazon. This is a big cause of shortages. Great story in the NYT about something that bought 10K items of sanitizer and masks. Intersting since needs to be sold on Amazon or E-Bay pretty easy to find. Also, E-bay makes 10%, and Amazon 15% so it's a great business for them.

### Glut of lobsters

Because no one can celebrate chinese new years which is a major consumer of lobsters, and lobster production was done pre-corona virus, lobsters are no dirt cheap.

### Prisoners making hand sanitizer.

The New York prison system is making inmates create hand sanitizer - that is awesome

## Bad data

I'm pretty angry about how the numbers are reproted. The US is only testing the ultra sick, so the death rate is super high and skewed old. Even at that super high rate it's still not that high relative to influeza killing 65+ see data @ [mortality post](/death)

The best data we have is from South Korea - deatails here.

## The non-health actual problems

## Economic impact

### Cruise ships

## Working from home

### Door dash thinks FB is a DDoS since all employees signed in at once.

### Big Tech still pays hourly workers.

### Restaurants and coffee shops empty when folks working from home.

## The best news - a false alarm.

Best, we have a mild outbreak to which we are over reacting, which gives us a wake alarm to build stuff tom make this better.

### What about big pharma

### Tech invoations

#### Nose filters

#### UV blasters

#### Goves that keep you from wiping your eyes

## Quarantines

#### Italy - Free Wifi

#### Italy - Mortgage Releif
