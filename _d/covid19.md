Corona Virus (CV) may be the defining moment in our lives. In such times, lets remember three things 1) Keep your circle of concern within your circle of influence 2) Don't feed mind mosters - see the positive 3) In crisis, you see both the best and worse. Focus on the best.

## Don't feed mind monsters, focus on the positive.

### Media's incentive is scaring you

From James Altchur: Media companies make money scaring you. Politicians stay in office (or get office) by assuming the worst case and hoping for the best so they can say, "Look, we did everything we could."  So ignore that. Also ignore the market. As I said the other day, as long as it's going up or down 5-10% a day, don't invest. There will be opportunities later.  Is the market cheap? It sure is. \$5,000,000,000,000 in stimulus is going to hit the economy, which is already assuming a worst-case scenario Depression which is not going to happen.

### Humanity has prioritize lives over profits

From [Mr. Money Moustache](https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/)

Assuming we are preventing 3 million early deaths, **this means our society is foregoing about one million dollars of economic activity for each person’s life that we extend and frankly, it makes me happy to know we are capable of that**.

In the more compassionate case which we are currently following, we drastically reduce the amount of contact we have with each other for a few months, which cuts the number of deaths in the US down from 3-6 million, down to perhaps 200,000. In exchange, our economy shrinks by several trillion dollars (it was about 21 trillion in 2019) for a year or more.

### Bill gates models being a class act.

Go watch how Bill Gates answers questions around how the goverment did nothing in February (the past is always outside the circle of influence). He ignores the bait on what we got wrong yesterday, and focuses on what we need to do today (core to the circle of influence) That's a class act leader:

- Interviewer: Trying to Stir a rage answer on why wasted on February
- Bill Gates: OK, we didn't act, but the good news is "focus on productive action"

### Tesla and Dyson making incubators

### 3M Refusing to ignore order to stop shipping PPE to other countries

### Big Tech still pays hourly workers.

## Circle of concern and circle of influence.

### Model good behavior

### Teddy bear brigade

### Virtual Playdates

### Setting up a minecraft server

## Some bizarre consequences

### Shortages caused by retail arbitrage.

I didn't realize this was a thing, but people buy stuff locally (often at thrift stores and garage sales and discount) and then sell it on Amazon. This is a big cause of shortages. Great story in the NYT about something that bought 10K items of sanitizer and masks. Intersting since needs to be sold on Amazon or E-Bay pretty easy to find. Also, E-bay makes 10%, and Amazon 15% so it's a great business for them.

### Glut of lobsters

Because no one can celebrate chinese new years which is a major consumer of lobsters, and lobster production was done pre-corona virus, lobsters are no dirt cheap.

### Prisoners making hand sanitizer.

The New York prison system is making inmates create hand sanitizer - that is awesome

### Door dash thinks FB is a DDoS since all employees signed in at once.

### Expected Tech innovations

#### Nose filters

#### UV blasters

#### Goves that keep you from wiping your eyes

## My optimizations

### Meet people for virtual coffees

### Get a home exercise routine

### Get dedicated electronics for the kids

### Figure our remote magic and lighting.

### Make a schedule when working from home

## Data

The data analysis during this defining event has been terrible. However, focusing on the positive, the gives me a chance to see how "good data is presented" and to build some of my own data visualization skills.

I've also got some realitve data on my [mortality post](/death), however I don't think the problem is mortality, it's the health system being overwhelmed and the economy, neither of which is reported.

### My personal dashboard

## The best news of all - a dry run of something fatal for the human race.

Not to underplay the current crisis, but imagine CV with the mortality rate of Ebola or SARS. that would have been the end of humanity. CV gives us a chance to learn process and prioritize so we'll be ready for the "big one".
