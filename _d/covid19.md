## Unexpected Consequences

### Glut of lobsters

Because no one can celebrate chinese new years which is a major consumer of lobsters, and lobster production was done pre-corona virus, lobsters are no dirt cheap.

### Prisoners making hand sanitizer.

The New York prison system is making inmates create hand sanitizer - that is awesome

## Bad data

I'm pretty angry about how the numbers are reproted. The US is only testing the ultra sick, so the death rate is super high and skewed old. Even at that super high rate it's still not that high relative to influeza killing 65+ see data @ [mortality post](/death)

The best data we have is from South Korea - deatails here.

## The non-health actual problems

## Economic impact

### Cruise ships

## Working from home

### Door dash thinks FB is a DDoS since all employees signed in at once.

### Big Tech still pays hourly workers.

### Restaurants and coffee shops empty when folks working from home.

## The best news - a false alarm.

Best, we have a mild outbreak to which we are over reacting, which gives us a wake alarm to build stuff tom make this better.

### What about big pharma

### Tech invoations

#### Nose filters

#### UV blasters

#### Goves that keep you from wiping your eyes

## Quarantines

#### Italy - Free Wifi

#### Italy - Mortgage Releif
