I'm incredibly fortunate to be able to take 6 weeks off this summer! From when performance reviews finish to when the kids go back to school, it'll be summer vacation.

It's a special year since Zach will be going into high school, and Amelia into Grade 5!

To get the most out of my time off, I'm going to follow my best practice of pre-writing what I want to get done, and adjust it as I go. This is a combination of [time off](/time-off), and all the stuff for [happiness](/happy), which I guess gets tangled up with half of my evergreen notes.

## Topic

### Divide and Conquer - By Person

Family time is great, but so is time together so I think I'll split the time up,

- A week with each kid, a week for myself, and a week for the family.
- All in one place, or travel the world.

### Bulk Discount - Staying at the beach house

### From 12 months to 6 weeks
