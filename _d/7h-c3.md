The key to effective management, is allocating energy through the lens of importance rather than urgency. E.g, ask yourself what one thing could you do that if you did on a regular basis, would make a tremendous positive difference in your life? Lemme guess, it's important, but not urgent so you're not doing it. These are my insights based on the [7 habits](/7h) Chapter 3.

Urgent matters are visible. They are usually in our face, popular with others, and pressing on us. We react to them which removes the need for discipline or proactivity.

The more time we spend in Quadrant 1, on problems and crisis, the more time we'll need there - problems will multiply. The only relief will be found by hiding in the distraction of Quadrants III and IV.

The way to shrink Quadrant I, is spending time in Quadrant II, essentially being proactive on things that avoid crisis.

## The power of independent will

### Lack of discipline? No, lack of purpose

_(Using the [switch](/switch) model - Motivate the elephant don't use the rider.)_

It's easy to think the reason you're not going to the gym is the lack of discipiline. But, if you look harder, it's probably a lack of purpose. If you reframe "going to the gym" as "staying healthy so I don't have a heart attack so I can see my daughters wedding", I bet you'll find lots of discipline.

### What it takes to say “NO”

When you say yes to a request, you are saying no to something else. [Essentialism](/essentialisim) has a great tool, either have a "hell yes", or it's a no. It also describes several tools for saying no in a way that doesn't damage the relationship.

## Planning

### Schedule your goals, not your meetings

Your calendar probably already has the standing things, meetings, gym, etc.
For each role, set goals, and then get those on the calendar.
Then fill in the rest with meetings as desired.

### Plan Weekly

Planning weekly lets you see the big picture, it lets you see your investments across your roles, and responsibilities. And gives you the flexibility to respond to relationships with the time required.

### You need balance

You can't make up for a loss of your health by doing a great job at work. Nor can your family make up for the fact you skipped your health and had a heart attack.

### Keep your self in quadrant II

### Focus on rocks and boulders

## Delegation - increasing P AND PC

### Stewardship delegation

From [Stewardship Delegation](/delegate):

_At some point you need to scale out, and that's called delegation! Stewardship delegation is a form of delegation where the responsibility for the delegated task is transferred to the delegatee. Stewardship delegation requires upfront effort, but the long term effectiveness it creates is second to none. Stewardship delegation has five parts you need to get a shared agreement on. The desired results, the operating parameters, the available resources, the measurement system and the consequences of their stewardship._
