Satisfaction is not a lack of dissatisfaction. SAT and DSAT are orthogonal dimensions you should consider independently. In a work context DSAT is the reason you can't sleep well at night, and SAT is the thing that makes you set your alarm to go off early Monday morning so you can get back at your favorite thing.

## Career

### Waking up in the night, excited to go to work.

DSAT is waking up in a panic angry at your co-worker, or stressed you'll fail.

SAT is being so excited about your project, you get up early Sunday morning to get a few extra hours in cuz you enjoy it so much.

### The combinations

| Label     | SAT High                         | SAT Low            |
| --------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| DSAT High | Analysis Required                | Time for a change  |
| DSAT Low  | Unicorn, stay as long as you can | Analysis Required! |

### Life is more important then Career

[On deathbeds, you never hear "I wish I spent more time at work"](/wlb). You have many [roles in your life](/eulogy), and your SAT and DSAT escape their role of original to impact all of your other roles. Your life SAT/DSAT is not a static linear combination that you decide, but a subconcious dynamic function, with many unpredictable step functions.

### High SAT Low DSAT

You've arrived. But this will likely pass. Learn what's working so you can replicate it later.

### High DSAT, Low SAT

Sounds like you need a change. Read [decisive](/decide) and [the dip](/the-dip)

### High SAT High DSAT

This often oscillates between stressed as shit, and amazing. These situations tend to be unsustainable.

Need to understand if the DSAT is structural or temporal, e.g. Just launch then everything calms down, or you're working with crappy people. If it's structural, there's an excellent chance the DSAT will grow into resentment, and then it'll be over.

### Low DSAT, Low SAT

The hardest case. You've got a great gig, but something is missing.

First, need to see if your low SAT is impacting your performance. If it is, this will become a problem and become high DSAT.

Second, need to see if you can redefine your role/responsiblities to include things that give you SAT. You'd be surprised, there are often tonnes.

Third, this setup doesn't rob you of energy from your other roles in life. Assuming you're performing well in this role, can you get your SAT from the extra energy you contribute to those other roles?
