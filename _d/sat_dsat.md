Satisfaction is not a lack of dissatisfaction. SAT and DSAT are orthogonal dimensions you should consider independently. In a work context DSAT is the reason you can't sleep well at night, and SAT is the thing that makes you set your alarm to go off early Monday morning so you can get back at your favorite thing.

### Career SAT/DSAT vs Life SAT/DSAT

If you've written your [eulogy](/eulogy), you'll be aware you have many roles in your life, and your SAT and DSAT flows between them. I suspect your global SAT/DSAT is not a weighted linear combination, but a hard to analyze non-linear function.
