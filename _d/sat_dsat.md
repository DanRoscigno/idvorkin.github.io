Satisfaction (SAT) is not a lack of dissatisfaction (DSAT). SAT and DSAT are orthogonal experiences. DSAT is the reason you can't sleep well at night, and SAT is reason you set your alarm for 5am so you can get an early start tackling your favorite problems.

SAT is being so excited about your project, you get up early Sunday morning to get a few extra hours in cuz you enjoy it so much.

### DSAT, SAT, Work and Life

[I wish I spent more time at work, is never uttured on a death bed](/wlb). You have many [roles beyond work in your life](/eulogy), and balancing between them is the definition of effectiveness.

High work SAT is great for your work, but this results in a [high stopping Energy, making activating](/activation) your other roles challenging. This is balanced, by the fact that Sat bringing good energy to other roles in your life.

### The consulting matrix

| --------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| DSAT High | Analysis Required                | Time for a change  |
| DSAT Low  | Unicorn, stay as long as you can | Analysis Required! |

### High SAT Low DSAT

You've arrived. But this will likely pass. Learn what's working so you can replicate it later.

### High DSAT, Low SAT

Change Required. Read [decisive](/decide) and [the dip](/the-dip).

### High SAT High DSAT

This often oscillates between stressed as shit, and amazing. These situations tend to be unsustainable.

Need to understand if the DSAT is structural or temporal, e.g. Just launch then everything calms down, or you're working with crappy people. If it's structural, there's an excellent chance the DSAT will grow into resentment, and then it'll be over.

### Low DSAT, Low SAT

The hardest case. You've got a great gig, but something is missing.

## From Low DSAT, Low SAT to unicorn land (Low DSAT; High SAT)

First, make nothing worse, you need to

**Ring fence your low SAT. Don't let it:**

- Effect your performance. When your performance tanks, DSAT will spike.
- Infect others. Emotions are contagious and if other catch your low SAT, you'll have problems soon.
- Ignore the things and people that are keeping your DSAT low. Without nurturing, and reinforcement they may stop.
- Drain your energy. See the low SAT as an opportunity to invest in some of your other roles.

**Mine for gold: Increase your SAT:**

Odd are you're struggling with a lack of [AMP](/manager-book#l-motivation) (see next section),

You've got 3 paths:

Add stuff that brings you SAT. Pick up extra projects which bring you AMP.

Cut stuff that doesn't bring you SAT

Examine the things that don't bring you SAT, and see what you can adjust to squeeze out more SAT. For example:

## Satisfaction - AMP

### Autonomy

### Mastery

### Purpose

## DSAT Deep Dive

### Conflict

### Insufficient Resources

### Insecurty

### WLB
