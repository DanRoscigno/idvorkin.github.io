Satisfaction (SAT) is not a lack of dissatisfaction (DSAT). SAT and DSAT are orthogonal experiences. DSAT is the reason you can't sleep well at night, and SAT is reason you set your alarm for 5am so you can get an early start tackling your favorite problems.

Maximizing your overall Satisfaction (SAT) and minimizing moments of dissatisfaction (DSAT) are equally important with your ability to feel content and happy. Not all SAT and DSAT are created equal nor are they always correlated. Symptoms of DSAT include dreading the feeling of going into work on Monday during your weekend, feeling so glad (but not happy) your workday is over at 5pm, being in a generally bad mood when talking to friends and family, or being unable to sleep at night. Symptoms of SAT manifest as waking up excited to work on a hard or interesting problem, a positive energy coming naturally when speaking with your team and cross-functional partners (for the most part), and not feeling like you need to surf LinkedIn Jobs or Indeed to find your next gig ASAP.

## General

### The Acid Test: How's your sleep

DSAT is waking up in a panic angry at your co-worker, or stressed you'll fail.
SAT is being so excited about your project, you get up early Sunday morning to get a few extra hours in cuz you enjoy it so much.

### Balance: Your life is more then your work.

[I wish I spent more time at work, is never uttered on a death bed](/wlb). You have many [roles beyond work in your life](/eulogy), and balancing between them is the definition of effectiveness.

High work SAT is great for your career, but often results in a [high stopping Energy, making activating](/activation) your other roles challenging. This is balanced by the fact that SAT is infectious bring inspiration and resilience to other roles in your life.

On the other hand even though low work SAT results in lower work stopping energy, low SAT can lower your overall energy and will power, resulting in less energy for your other roles.

## The situations a 2x2 matrix

| DSAT/SAT  | SAT High                         | SAT Low            |
| --------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| DSAT High | Analysis Required                | Time for a change  |
| DSAT Low  | Unicorn, stay as long as you can | Analysis Required! |

### High SAT Low DSAT

You've arrived. But this will likely pass. Learn what's working so you can replicate it later.

### High DSAT, Low SAT

Urgent Change Required. Read [decisive](/decide), [the dip](/the-dip), and if required re-roll.

### High SAT High DSAT

This often oscillates between stressed as shit, and amazing. These situations tend to be unsustainable.

Need to understand if the DSAT is structural or temporal, e.g. Just launch then everything calms down, or you're working with crappy people. If it's structural, there's an excellent chance the DSAT will grow into resentment, and you'll need to re-roll.

### Low DSAT, Low SAT

The hardest case. You've got a great gig, but something is missing.

## Influencing change

There are two changes you'd like to make, increase your SAT, and decreasing you DSAT.

### Making the perfect job: Raising SAT

First, make nothing worse, you need to

**Ring fence your low SAT. Don't let it:**

- Effect your performance. When your performance tanks, DSAT will spike.
- Infect others. Emotions are contagious and if other catch your low SAT, you'll have problems soon.
- Ignore the things and people that are keeping your DSAT low. Without nurturing, and reinforcement they may stop.
- Drain your energy. See the low SAT as an opportunity to invest in some of your other roles.

**Mine for gold: Increase your SAT:**

Odd are you're struggling with a lack of [AMP](/manager-book#l-motivation) (see next section),

You've got 3 paths:

Add stuff that brings you SAT. Pick up extra projects which bring you AMP.

Cut stuff that doesn't bring you SAT

Examine the things that don't bring you SAT, and see what you can adjust to squeeze out more SAT. For example:

### Sleeping well at night: Lowering DSAT

DSAT is often caused by people or structural problems. These are hard to influence.

Even when there are are small improvements you may have residual [mental pain](/mental-pain), which leaves reactive, slowing your ability to lower DSAT.

Sometimes the right thing to do here is a re-roll.

### Re-rolling: Changing teams or companies

When you have a structural problem and you can't influence the changes you need (see [the dip](/dip)), the right thing to do may be finding a new team or company.

While easy to think, it's very easy to mis-assess the situation. The grass is always greener on the other side of the fence, and sometimes the issue you think is your environment, may be you. Before you go down this path, skim [decisive](/decisive) and listen to [switching jobs or staying where you are](https://heathbrothers.com/member-content/decisive-for-job-decisions/decisive-for-job-decisions-2/). It takes 30 minutes, but given how hard job changes are, I strongly recommend it.
