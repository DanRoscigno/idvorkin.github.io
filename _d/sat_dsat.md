Satisfaction is not a lack of dissatisfaction. SAT and DSAT are orthogonal dimensions you should consider independently. In a work context DSAT is the reason you can't sleep well at night, and SAT is the thing that makes you set your alarm to go off early Monday morning so you can get back at your favorite thing.

## Career

### Waking up in the night, excited to go to work.

DSAT is waking up in a panic angry at your co-worker, or stressed you'll fail.

SAT is being so excited about your project, you get up early Sunday morning to get a few extra hours in cuz you enjoy it so much.

### The combinations

| Label     | SAT High                         | SAT Low            |
| --------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| DSAT High | Analysis Required                | Time for a change  |
| DSAT Low  | Unicorn, stay as long as you can | Analysis Required! |

### Life is more important then Career

[On deathbeds, you never hear "I wish I spent more time at work"](/wlb). You have many [roles in your life](/eulogy), and your SAT and DSAT flows out of your control, between them. Your life SAT/DSAT is not a static linear combination you decide, but a hard to subconcious dynamic function, with many unpredictable step functions.
