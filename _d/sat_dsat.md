Satisfition is not a lack of dissatisfaction. SAT and DSAT are orthoginal dimensions you should consider independantly. In a work context DSAT is the reason you can't sleep well at night, and SAT is the thing that makes you set your ararm to go off earlyearly Monday morning so you can get back at your favorite thing.

If you've written your [eulogy](/eulogy), you'll be aware you have many roles in your life, and your SAT and DSAT flows between them. I suspect your global SAT/DSAT is not a weighted linear combination, but a hard to analyze non-linear function.
