Stop. Take an ice cold shower right now. You didn't, did you? Trust me, even if you tried, you wouldn't. Before you turned on the water, you'd have this irrational fear of stepping in and you wouldn't do it. The force that stops you is the resistance. The resistance is the personification of the force that stops you from doing the important. The resistance lies, telling us things are hard, when they are not. The resistance adds suffering, when there is minimal pain - and that confuses us, stopping us from doing the things which give us the most value, joy, and positive identity.

The seminal work on the resistance is [Flinch](https://github.com/idvorkin/blob/blob/master/books/the-flinch.pdf).

## The resistance is what stops us from doing the important.

### [Pain vs Suffering](/mental-pain)

### At the extreme - [Addiction](/addiction)

### Magic Tricks for strangers

[Magician](/magic) is one of my treasured identities. Few things make me happier then doing magic, but the resistance battles me here constantly.

The hardest part of magic, the hardest part by a mile, the #1 thing that stops me from doing magic is asking someone if they want to see a magic trick. 9 out of 10 people say yes. For the 1 of 1010 who say no, I've wasted less then 15s of their time (and mine).

But I always freeze before asking someone if they want to see a trick, sometimes the resistance talks me out of doing it quickly, sometimes it fights me for minutes, sometimes, maybe 10% of the time, I can fight through the resistance, and ask, and then perform my trick, for their enjoyment.

I've **never** regretted showing someone a magic trick, I've never regretting being told someone doesn't want to do a magic trick, but I frequently regret not doing a magic trick.

At my very best, I applied a powerful antidote. I told myself I'd ask the first person I saw if they wanted to see a magic trick, I'd repeat this for each person I saw till I completed a magic trick.

### Skipping the diet or gym

### Procrasting the string that's stressing you at work

### Not doing Amazon returns

## Fighting the resistance

### The 3 lies of laziness

- **Glorifying not important, not urgent activity** Finally I have time to watch TV, so glad, otherwise I'm good)
- **Amplifying effort required to do one's best:** Man taking the 1 minute to get up and taking out the garbage, what a burden.
- **Minimizing reward of doing one's best.** Is taking out the garbage, a sign of huge respect or my wife really unimportant?

### If you don't beat it back, it will get stronger.

Every victory over the resistance will give you the strength for the next victory. Every loss will make it harder.

### [Jump in the lake day](https://ig66.blogspot.com/search/label/jump_in_lake_day)

To remind me the resistance is a huge enemy, I do a polar bear plunge every new years, I call it jump in the lake day.

### Positive [Habits](/habits) and Routine

Every day I wake up at 5am, it's my first victory over the resistance, and it gives me strength to fight through the day.
