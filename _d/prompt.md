title: Prompts, your guide to starting a conversation
permalink: /prompts
---

A prompt will kick start a great conversation, a great insight, and a great releationship. Here are lots of prompts. For fun, pick a prompt at random and ask it to someone else, or answer it yourself. However, it takes a lot of trust and vulnerability to answer these questions, so make sure the person feels very empowered to not answer a question.

## Work Prompts

_From the [awkward 1:1](https://medium.com/@mrabkin/the-art-of-the-awkward-1-1-f4e1dcbd1c5c) and Holloway's remote management guide_

    Too many choices? Pick a catory and then ask the question in the blue box!

### Give extra honest feedback

- Are they acting like the best manager / report / partner you could wish for? Are you? Why or why not? Discuss.
- What have you already told someone else about this person (or heard others say)? Share with them. Discuss.
- What is everyone around neglecting to tell this person?
- What’s the work equivalent of this person having food stuck in their teeth? Be a good friend / coworker and tell them.

### Receive extra honest feedback

Remember skip the fluffy answer and ask again until you get something real.

- Tell them a growth area you’re working on currently. Tell them why you picked it (even if it was one of those “not-really-optional” ones!).
- Ask for advice.
- Check for your own role in a weird situation.
- Pick a thing you've recently complained about. Ask them — “What could I've done differently in that situation?” Ask for feedback on how to be better.
- Admit a fault or a mistake. Ask for support and advice. Ask them if they noticed you making it or not.


### Career Growth

- When did you recently get an opportunity to learn and grow? How can we create more of those?
- Have you seen someone else doing something you felt worked really well? What was it?
- What should I know about you that would help me support you better?
- What are you doing here that you feel is most in line with your long-term goals?
- If you could be proud of one accomplishment between now and next year, what would it be?
- Is anything holding you back from doing the best work you can do right now?
- Is there a project or area outside your current role where you feel you could be contributing?
- Which areas make you feel like your hands are tied or you are unable to reach your full potential?
- If you were to create your ideal position, how would it differ from what you are currently doing?
- At what point in the past week were you most frustrated with or discouraged by your work? What can I do to help you manage that?

### Seeking feedback

_To get some deep feedback, use the prompts in getting extra honest feedback._

Or ask the more boring questions

- Would you like more or less direction from me?
- Would you like more or less feedback on your work? If more, what additional feedback would you like?
- If you were coaching me to have a greater positive impact, what would you tell me?
- What can I tell you about myself that might make it easier to understand me and work with me?
- Have you seen a product or initiative at another company recently and thought to yourself, ‘I wish we’d done that’?
- What vibrations (news, rumors, dynamics) are you picking up that you think I should know about?
- What’s our biggest oversight, and how do we resolve it?
- What do you feel is our biggest risk right now?
- What was the most useful part of our conversation today?
- What are you worried about right now?

### Building relationships

- How’s life?
- What’s going on for you these days outside of work?
- What is something you've done that you’re proud of?
- What was something you were scared of as a child? Have you overcome it?
- What fictional character do you most identify with?
- Would you rather be known or unknown? Why?
- What hot topic usually turns into an argument for you?
- Do you have a motto or personal mantra?
- What’s on your bucket list?

### Transition and change questions

- Imagine it’s two years from now, and things have gone well: What has been your role in that? What does your role look like?
- What are you worried might happen if you made this transition?
- What will happen if you don’t take this step?
- What would need to change for you to get to a point of “let’s do this” or “I don’t want this”? What information do you need?

### Team dynamics

- How would you say we’re doing at working together as a team? What makes you say that?
- What do you think the rest of the team is most concerned about? (People may also share what they are personally concerned about; this framing makes it easier to share.)
- Who on the team is doing really well right now? (Also listen for names that don’t come up.)

### Well-being

- Are there any decisions you’re hung up on?
- I've noticed you’re a little quieter than usual. Is there anything you’d like to talk about?
- Do you feel stretched thin? (This wording is useful to measure subjective stress, not objective workload.)
- What, if anything, did you used to do that you find you don’t have time for right now?
- What is your takeaway from this discussion? (This is especially helpful to get to action steps from a thorny issue.)
- In our last one-on-one you mentioned you were frustrated by X and wanted to try Y as a solution. How has that been going?
- During this meeting you've mentioned that you’d like to pursue X. What steps can you take toward that before our next one-on-one?
- What could we change about work that would improve the rest of your life?

### Conflict resolution

- What does your ideal outcome look like? (Could be about a specific conflict that’s come up, or approached hypothetically.)
- What’s hard for you in getting to that outcome?
- What do you really care about?
- What’s the worst-case scenario you’re worried about?

### Getting deeper

- Are you afraid of anything at work?
- I've noticed that our last several one-on-ones have stayed pretty surface. What are your honest impressions of this meeting? What could we be doing differently or better?
- What’s something you used to strongly believe in that you no longer do today?
- Before making a telephone call, do you ever rehearse what you are going to say? Why?
- What are three things you and I appear to have in common?
- What do you feel most grateful for in your life?
- Take four minutes and tell me your life story in as much detail as possible.
- If you could wake up tomorrow having gained any one quality or ability, what would it be?
- Is there something that you've dreamed of doing for a long time? Why haven’t you done it?
- What do you value most in a friendship?
- What, if anything, is too serious to be joked about?

### Meta & Feelings

Talk about emotions. Label one you’re feeling, or what you sense from other person. Boom, instant awkward and great discussion.

- Any meta-conversation about your conversations.
- We never talk about Topic A, we just always talk Topic B. Why is that?
- When I tell you about Topic A, you always react like this, and that’s why I don’t tell you that stuff. When I bring up Topic B, how do you feel? Why is that?
- Ask for their fears. What are they afraid of (for their career, the project, an upcoming tough meeting)? Why? Share your own.
- Trust check. How easy is it for both of you to share intimate things with each other? Why? What would make it easier? Discuss.
