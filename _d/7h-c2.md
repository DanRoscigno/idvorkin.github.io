All things are created twice, once in the design phase, and then again in the implementation phase. If you don't perform the first creation, someone else will. At the extreme, imagine your eulogy, that's the end too.

These are my insights based on the [7 habits](/7h) Chapter 2.

### All things are created twice

### By design or by default

### Rescripting yourself

### False Centers

What it looks like when you're centered on the wrong thing. Usually by too much

| Center          | Attributes                                                   |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Loving Kindness | Wish for someone to be happy                                 |
| Compassion      | Wish for someone to be free of suffering                     |
| Altruistic Joy  | Be happy for [self](/joy) or [other](/touching) bringing joy |
| Equanimity      | Remaining Calm, regardless of circumstance                   |
