All things are created twice, once in the design phase, and then again in the implementation phase. If you don't perform the first creation, someone else will. At the extreme, imagine your eulogy, that's the end too.

These are my insights based on the [7 habits](/7h) Chapter 2.

### All things are created twice

### By design or by default

### Rescripting yourself

### Eulogy Writing
