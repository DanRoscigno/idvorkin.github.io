Shame and guilt are similar emotions that lead to contrasting behaviors. Shame drives people to hide or deny their wrongdoings while guilt drives people to amend their mistakes.

Unrealistic expectations cause into failure
Unmet commitments harden into failure
Failure hardens into guilt.
Guilt hardens into shame.

Shame reinforces itself through rumination.

Shame - I am bad
Guilt - I did something bad
