### Scott's Imposter Syndrom

A great post that was many techie's first introduction to [Imposter Syndrome](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/ImAPhonyAreYou.aspx)

A few quotes from people he asked about these feelings:

- I always feel like a phony just biding my time until I'm found out. It definitely motivates me to excel further, hoping to outrun that sensation that I'm going to be called out for something I can't do
- Plenty of times! Most recently I started a new job where I've been doing a lot of work in a language I'm rusty in and all the "Woot I've been doing 10 years worth of X language" doesn't mean jack. Very eye opening, very humbling, very refreshing
- Quite often. I don't truly think I'm a phony, but certainly there are crises of confidence that happen... particularly when I get stuck on something and start thrashing.
- Quite often actually, especially on sites like stack overflow. It can be pretty intimidating and demotivating at times. Getting started in open source as well. I usually get over it and just tell myself that I just haven't encountered a particular topic before so I'm not an expert at it yet. I then dive in and learn all I can about it.
- I think you are only a phony when you reflect your past work and don't feel comfortable about your own efforts and achievements.
