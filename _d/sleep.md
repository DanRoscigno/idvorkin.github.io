[Bryan Johnson](/blueprint) says sleep is like life on easy mode. He has lots to say on this, and it gets technical, and I think I agree:

### Bed Heater/Cooler - Eight Sleep

Ok, I used to use a mattress pad warmer, it was glorious. The Sleep 8 is like that but cooler! Pun intended, it's able to both heat and cool your bed. Basically a heat pump w/radiator. It also adjusts as you sleep so you go to bed warm (who wants a cold bed), cools you through the evening, then cooks you to get you out of bed in the morning. Super expensive, but probably worth it given it's a lifetime investment in your sleep. Humorously - cooking is the best alarm clock.

### Consistent bedtime

### Caffeine

### Alcohol

Sleep well.
