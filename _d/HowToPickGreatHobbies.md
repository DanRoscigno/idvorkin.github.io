Hobby - An activity done in ones leisure time for pleasure. This post gives you more reasons to find a hobby and teaches you the attributes you'd like in a hobby. The attributes of an ideal hobby are being accessible, having legs, reinforcing your identity, and build relationships.

### Why find a hobby

If having "an activity you do for pleasure" doesn't instantly resonate, let me add some depth.

Being [satisfied](https://ig2600.blogspot.com/2015/07/a-richer-model-of-happiness.html) is the point of life, and your hobby supports satisfaction by reinforcing your identity and helping you build relationships. A good hobby puts you in flow, giving pleasure by itself, and resting your mind from life's stressors. Because you're constantly improving at your hobby you'll feel a sense of mastery which not only feels good, but also reinforces your self confidence.

If you don't have time for a hobby because you need all your energy for work and family, you should reconsider.
When your work an family are going great it doesn't much matter, but when work and family start getting rocky, and it will, having a hobby can be a life saver.

### What makes a good hobby

While most things can be a hobby, the ideal hobby is accessible, has legs, reinforcing your identity, and builds relationships. Getting all these attributes is hard so strive for a hobby that gives as many as possible.


**Accessible** You can do the best hobbies anywhere with minimal props and setup. While it's good to be able to do your hobby with others, an ideal hobby an also be done by yourself. Without accessibly, you'll be doing your hobby infrequently, which defeats the purpose.

Knitting has great accessibility. You can do it anywhere, all you need is your needles and a ball of yarn. Scuba diving has poor accessibility. You need all the scuba diving gear, a big body of water, and a dive buddy.

**Has Legs** The best hobbies let you continually improve. Ideally they have a progression of goals which when accomplished give you pride, and can be continued as you get into your golden years. Without legs, it's easy to get bored with your hobby when you "top out" and have nothing else to learn.

Chess has legs. When you start playing chess you barely know the rules, and the more you study and play, the better you get. Even better, you can keep playing chess till you're pretty darn old.  Watching TV does not have legs.  Watch as much as you want, your just as bad (or good, if you're a glass half full person) as the day you started.

**Reinforcing identity/Creating Connection** You want to share it with others

- Share with other practitioners
- Share by doing it for others

## What happens when your hobby has an attribute


**Having purpose** My little pony fans that go to conferences.

## What happens when your hobby lacks an attribute

**Lacking purpose: Watching TV**  It's so

### FAQ

**This sounds like Autonomy/Mastery/Competence/Purpose/Relatedness** For those unfamiliar with the terms,  Autonomy, Mastery, Purpose (AMP) is Danial Pink's model for motivation. Autonomy, Competence, Relatedness (ACR) is the almost identical model articulated in self determination theory. These models are often used in the context of motivation for work and apply equally to hobbies. Accessibility is my word for autonomy, has legs is my word for Mastery/Competence and Purpose/Relatedness is my word for Purpose/Relatedness.

**What's the difference between hobbies and habits?** This gets into nomenclature. In my model, hobbies as things that make you happy while habits (the positive ones)  make you healthy. Practicing your hobby can become a habit.

**Should I have my hobby be my work?** I'd recommend strongly against it for two reasons. First, because it's your work you'll need to prioritize what makes your customers happy over what makes you happy and second, because if works goes badly, you'll also lose your hobby, which is normally a strong buffer to enjoying your life.

**What's your hobby** My current hobby is magic. All I need is a coin or a deck of cards and I can do it anywhere. Magic has incredible technical depth, and every few months I get better and better. Magic lets me be a "Maker of smiles and wonder" which is core to my identity, and lets me connect to magicians to tune my craft, and strangers for brief interactions of smiles and wonder.

**Did you change your hobby**  Yes. One of my early hobbies was scuba diving.  Going scuba diving take a lot of gear and preparation. Even worse you need a dive buddy who has the matching will to make it happen. My scuba gear has been gathering dust for a long while, and my wife keep threatening to sell it. After scuba diving,  I loved squash and fencing, both fantastic hobbies, but as I crossed into my late thirties, those caused my tendentious to flair, and are too hard on my body.

Next up was juggling, which for me is a fantastic hobby. It meets all my criteria, except it's less accessible then magic and harder to for a connection. E.g.  Juggling clubs don't fit in your back pocket, you get strange looks juggling at the bar, and smoke detectors go crazy at the smell of flaming torches.  While juggling lets you connect with folks, it's not nearly as intimate connection as magic as you can't strike up a conversation or personalize the juggling for the spectator.
