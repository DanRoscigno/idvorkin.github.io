### FAQ

**This sounds like Autonomy/Master/Compertence/Purpose/Relatedness** Autonomy, Mastery, Purpose (AMP) is Danial Pink's model for motivation.  Autonomy, Competence, Relatedness (ACR) is the self determination theory.  Both of these models apply to motivation and work, are similarly applicable to hobbies. Accessibility is my word for autonomy, has legs is my word for Mastery/Cometencen and Purpose/Relatedness is my word for Purpose/Relatedness.

**What's the difference between hobbies and habits?** This gets into nomenclature, I think of hobbies as things that make you happy and habits (well positive ones) as things that make you healthy. In this set of definitions, practicing your hobby is a habit.

**Should I aspire to have my hobby be my work?** I'd recommend strongly against it for two reasons. First, because it's your work you'll need to prioritize what makes your customers happy over what makes you happy and second, because if works goes badly, you'll also lose your hobby, which is normally a strong buffer to enjoying your life.
