Selling matters - it's pitching, convincing, negotiating, hiring. Selling has a bad rap, because the seller often puts their needs ahead of the buyer - a win/lose paradigm. You should make selling win/win or no deal by needing to answer yes to these questions. 1/ If the buyer agrees, will their life improve? 2/ When the deal is done, will the world be a better place than when you began?

To sell is human is a treatise on the modern form of sales. Part I describes why selling is important, and how it has evolved. Part II focuses on the how to be a salesman and Part III focuses on what you need to do to do sales.

### Pitch

As you prepare your pitch, whichever variety you choose, clarify your purpose and strategy by making sure you can answer these three questions: After someone hears your pitch . . .

- What do you want them to know?
- What do you want them to feel?
- What do you want them to do?

1. The One-Word Pitch Pro tip: Write a fifty-word pitch. Reduce it to twenty-five words. Then to six words. One of those remaining half-dozen is almost certainly your one-word pitch. Your try: ****\*\*****\_****\*\*****.

2. The Question Pitch Pro tip: Use this if your arguments are strong. If they’re weak, make a statement. Or better yet, find some new arguments. Your try: ****\*\*****\_****\*\*****?

3. The Rhyming Pitch Pro tip: Don’t rack your brain for rhymes. Go online and find a rhyming dictionary. I’m partial to RhymeZone (http:// www.rhymezone.com). Your try: ****\*\*****\_****\*\*****.

4. The Subject Line Pitch Pro tip: Review the subject lines of the last twenty e-mail messages you’ve sent. Note how many of them appeal to either utility or curiosity. If that number is less than ten, rewrite each one that fails the test. Your try: ****\*\*****\_****\*\*****.

5. The Twitter Pitch Pro tip: Even though Twitter allows 140 characters, limit your pitch to 120 characters so that others can pass it on. Remember: The best pitches are short, sweet, and easy to retweet. Your try: ****\*\*****\_****\*\*****.

6. The Pixar Pitch Pro tip: Read all twenty-two of former Pixar story artist Emma Coats’s story rules: http:// bit.ly/ jlVWrG Your try: Once upon a time **\*\*\*\***\_\_**\*\*\*\***. Every day, **\*\***\_\_**\*\***. One day **\*\***\_\_\_**\*\***. Because of that, ****\*\*****\_\_\_****\*\*****. Because of that, **\*\***\_**\*\***. Until finally **\*\***\_\_\_\_**\*\***.
