### Anxiety - Reality vs Expectations

### The pain and suffering of the mind

1. Anxiety is Pain, Stress is Suffering
1. Pain is designed for threatening circumstance drawing your attention for a problem requiring urgent attention. This narrows your perspective.
1. Psychiatrist calls this the difference between the desire to control, and the fact it's uncontrallable.

### Reality

### Expectations

Your expectation is whatyo you
Being in control is a simplification. Regardless of what you want to achieve, you may be hit be a strike of lightning, and you'll lose the ability to control it.

The closest to control that can be achieved is maximum influence over the situation.

1. Expecations is often achieving desired fixed position.
1. A few models can be applied to expecations.
1. First, broaden the desired end state - from Getting to Yes, convert your position into a desired outcome (What do you really need to solve).
1. Second, focus on your circle of include - From 7 Habits, Habit 1, focus on your circle of influence not circle of concern.
1. By changing your desired reality from "I need X to happen" to "I will influence to get closer to my desired outcome for X", you are focused on your true need, and converting to action.
1. This reduces ANxiety as the desired reality is now equal to your expectations.
1. Parodixaclly, by focusing on your circle of influence, you increase your influence, making you more effective in achieving the desired outcome.
1. Naively, you can conclude someone gave up and shirking responsibility by not going for it. However, assuming you are exerting your maximum influence, this is the closest you can get to achieving your desired outcome, being upset because you can't achieve the impossible, doesn't help anyone.

Now, to be responsible, you need to communicate when there is a change in outcome, and apply WIN/WIN, Seek First to Understand, Synergy and Getting To Yes to adjust and keep everyone informed.

### Closing the gap

So increasing your perspective. When it comes to the remodel stress, expand. Sure, right now there is pain, but look how small it is in the bigger picture, on the expected value through everythign else is still very hight, and that's likely the optimum point.

A way to automatically increase perspective is humor, it breaks us out of our revery, and lets us laugh (TBD, postive vs negative stress). A flip side of this is, if you notice you're not laughing, nore enjoying other parts of life, you need to expand your perspective.

Intresting, I picked up a mantra, "This too shall pass", with the idea of smoothing out the highs and the lows, the Pschyatrist observed this is the buddhist impermance idea, which BTW is not apathy. So this is helpful as it reducing suffering, which is attachment, to cut attachment, the good isn't as valuable, and the bad isn't as concerning. Yup, I wonder if switching my mantra from this too shall pass to more, how does this look in a larger time frame?

### The Perspective Graph

Perspective can be imagined in two dimensions - X=time and Y=Co(t).

**Co(t)** The amount of things being considered. This can be from a single insult to your life. The units on this are unclear, for now, lets normalize from 0 to all the things you can be considering accross all aspects of your life.

**SIDEBAR: Mu(t)** is a concept I [explored long ago](http://ig2600.blogspot.com/2015/05/measuring-in-moment-happiness-with.html) Measuring in the moment happiness (InMoHap). It's not the perfect measure, but might be more useful then Co. for this convo.

So Co(t) is how much we are considering at time.

Therefore, perspective is the area of the graph being considered. This is likely a dominant factor in Mu(t)

1. Because anxiety narrows your perspective, you need to actively fight against this, both proactively, and in the moment when it strikes.

1. So the key is to maximize the area, and it gets small when you stop thinking of the past, and the future, also actively pruning the breadth of your thinking.

1. Proactively reminder to look at a larger time frame.

#### Pain=Anxiety narrows perspective to resolve immediate danger.

Anxiety, being pain, reduces the perspective, and this leads to increased stress and suffering.

### Prophylactics - Preventive Medicine

#### Perspective

Anxiety, being pain, reduces the perspective, and this leads to increased stress and suffering.

1. Detection, as it's a sub concious process that happens
2. Remind ourselves of the larger time dimension and then many aspects of our lives.

### Detection

- Poor sleep
- Lack of humor
- Rumination in the [idle loop](/idle-loop)

### Antidotes
