Anxiety is the difference between reality and expectations. It is the pain, while stress is the suffering. The
pain of anxiety is designed for threatening circumstance drawing your attention for a problem requiring urgent attention. This narrows your perspective allowing you to focus on a resolution. However, like many autonomous systems anxiety can be over triggered, and handled poorly without deliberate action.

### Anxiety

#### Reality

1. Psychiatrist calls this the difference between the desire to control, and the fact it's uncontrallable.

#### Expectations

Your expectation is what you want to achieve (aka control). You assumed you had control over this, but being in control is a simplification (though a very useful one). In an extreme example, regardless of what you want to control, you may be hit by a bolt of lightning, and you'll lose the ability to control it.

Instead of desire to control, aspire to have the maximum influence over the outcome. A few models can be applied to help.

Expectations is often achieving desired fixed position.

1. First, broaden the desired end state - from Getting to Yes, convert your position into a desired outcome (What do you really need to solve).
1. Second, focus on your circle of include - From 7 Habits, Habit 1, focus on your circle of influence not circle of concern (What will **I do** to improve the situation)

- By changing your desired reality from "I need X to happen" to "I will influence to get closer to my desired outcome for X", you are focused on your true need, and converting to action. This reduces Anxiety as the desired reality is now equal to your expectations, and you can focus on influening

Paradoxically, by focusing on your circle of influence, you increase your influence, making you more effective in achieving the desired outcome.

Naively, you can conclude someone gave up and is shirking responsibility by 'settling' for influence not control. However, assuming you are exerting your maximum influence, this is the closest you can get to achieving your desired outcome, being upset because you can't achieve the impossible, doesn't help anyone.

Now, to be responsible, you need to communicate when there is a change in outcome, and apply WIN/WIN, Seek First to Understand, Synergy and Getting To Yes to adjust and keep everyone informed.

#### Closing the gap

So increasing your perspective. When it comes to the remodel stress, expand. Sure, right now there is pain, but look how small it is in the bigger picture, on the expected value through everythign else is still very hight, and that's likely the optimum point.

A way to automatically increase perspective is humor, it breaks us out of our revery, and lets us laugh (TBD, postive vs negative stress). A flip side of this is, if you notice you're not laughing, nore enjoying other parts of life, you need to expand your perspective.

Intresting, I picked up a mantra, "This too shall pass", with the idea of smoothing out the highs and the lows, the Pschyatrist observed this is the buddhist impermance idea, which BTW is not apathy. So this is helpful as it reducing suffering, which is attachment, to cut attachment, the good isn't as valuable, and the bad isn't as concerning. Yup, I wonder if switching my mantra from this too shall pass to more, how does this look in a larger time frame?

### Perspective

Perspective can be imagined in two dimensions - X=time and Y=Co(t).

**Co(t)** The amount of things being considered. This can be from a single insult to your life. The units on this are unclear, for now, lets normalize from 0 to all the things you can be considering accross all aspects of your life.

**SIDEBAR: Mu(t)** is a concept I [explored long ago](http://ig2600.blogspot.com/2015/05/measuring-in-moment-happiness-with.html) Measuring in the moment happiness (InMoHap). It's not the perfect measure, but might be more useful then Co. for this convo.

So Co(t) is how much we are considering at time.

Therefore, perspective is the area of the graph being considered. This is likely a dominant factor in Mu(t)

1. Because anxiety narrows your perspective, you need to actively fight against this, both proactively, and in the moment when it strikes.

1. So the key is to maximize the area, and it gets small when you stop thinking of the past, and the future, also actively pruning the breadth of your thinking.

1. Proactively reminder to look at a larger time frame.

#### Narrows perspective to resolve immediate danger.

Anxiety, being pain, reduces the perspective, and this leads to the suffering of stress

1. Detection, as it's a sub concious process that happens
2. Remind ourselves of the larger time dimension and then many aspects of our lives.

#### Caring vs Mattering

When something happens, we have an unconscious emotional response. The intensity of this response is a subjective experience, how much we care. (Sometimes through conditioning, we have emotional triggers which make us care highly and become hyper sensitive to the stimulus)

The objective analog to caring is how much it matters. To maintain consistency your brain automatically assumes how much something matters is the same as how much you care. For example:

_Imagine you are parking, and someone takes your spot. You have an intense emotional reaction, you care deeply, and react like this matters deeply. However, from an objective stand point, the total cost is likely low minutes of impact._

Even though mattering is objective, it needs to be "measured" in a system, which (like perspective) has a time dimension, and an amount of other things to take into account perspective. For example:

For example, imagine your kid doesn't want to go to bed on time, and they push back to you saying go to bed with no, it doesn't matter. In the span of 4 hours, it matters as it damages the relationship and frustrates the relationship. In the span of 20 years, it's irrelevant. In the context of all the bond a parent and child have it's also irrelevant. (There's perhaps a subtlety here for discipline and habit building)

**Caring and mattering for others**

Speaking of the mind assuming caring and mattering are equivalent, think about a time someone you really trust and respect (spouses are a great example) tells you thing that's causing you a deep emotional response doesn't matter. This usually makes it much worse not better.

**The gentle act of helping others assess how much things matter**

1. Acknowledge how they're feeling. It's very real.
1. Assume their assessment is correct, and seek to understand it.
1. Ask permission to discuss understanding how and why they care.
1. Listen to why they are feeling strongly, it's essential you understand (Habit 5 - Seek First to understand)

Depending on the depth of the relationship and the reaction so far, it might be a good time to stop, or a good time to continue. If continue

1. Ask permission to ask questions to clarify how much it matters.
1. Use the non threatening 3 W's (but not Why/How).
   1. When - What time range
   1. Who - Who will be most impacted
   1. Where - What parts of "all properties" will be effected.

### Detection

- Poor sleep
- Lack of humor
- Rumination in the [idle loop](/idle-loop)
