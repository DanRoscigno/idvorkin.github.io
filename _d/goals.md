## Why goals

Answer what, why, and how do we know there.

## Mission, Vision, Tenants, Goals

## What vs How

## Goal systems OKR vs SMART

### SMART Goals

- Specific
- Measurable
- Achievable
- Relevant
- Time Bound

### OKR

- Objective
- Key Results
  - Time bound is implicit in the OKR time range.

Philisophical Difference

[Example OKRs](https://www.whatmatters.com/get-examples)

### Measuring goals

You have to decide if metrics should be used for visiblity vs for evaluation and sticks.

If goals are used for compensation, become very conservative.

Results in extrinsic, not intrinsic motivation.

### Extrinsic vs Intrinsic Motivations

### Transparent Goals

### Philosphy

## Metrics Anti-Patterns

- Measuring what is easy vs what is important

  - Looking for keys under steet light - but keys are over there, why looking here? Cuz that's where we have light

- Using a metric to flog instead of to learn

  - Sev's are bad, people won't create SEVs, will use alterate systems

- Measuring a proxy, not intent
  - Goal, get rid of foxes. Solution, 5\$ per fox paid; People started breeding foxes to put them down.

## Wrong KPIs

- For a library - Count books vs Customer Engagement

## Input vs output metrics

asdf

## Culture vs Strategy

- Culture lets you make decisions quickly and correctly
