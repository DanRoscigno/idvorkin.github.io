One of the most satisfying (and fun) projects I worked on in my career was giving Alexa customers the ability to donate to charity and then have Amazon match their donations. What is most amazing about this project is we were able to go from zero to announcing our MVP live on good morning america in under 4 months which included all sorts of complexities, negotiations, and good luck.

The details are amazon specific, but a few things I can mention

- Called out in the SVP mail to all of Amazon on impactful things we did.

- Get team to agree it was all or nothing to launch
- Non stop problems

## Cool stories - First Launch

- So many toys needed to rotate Toys For Tots Shipping locations
- Begging team in Spain for help
