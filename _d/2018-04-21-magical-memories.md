Magic is a huge part of my identity, and this post will help me remember why.

My memories of magic:

How I started:

Carl Bystrom's class at magic with a french drop jack routine (great intro Carl - thanks!)

Not knowing how to shuffle and thus having to learn to shuffle till my fingers bled.

Meeting the emerald city wizards, adn the first night with professional magicians.

Meeting Felix, and then Jarrod.

I was at a restuarant that did table magic (which I LOVED), and the magician did trick after trick, finally with card to ceiling.

Highlights:

- Doing card to ceiling and the card still being on the ceiling at Microsoft a year later
  (TODO - get a photo)

  - Girl on the bus that loved my magic trick.
  - Girl at ice cream store who loved the trick, and jump up and down in a circle cuz it was so awesome.
  - Ben's son who carried the card around in his back pack for years.

- Failure at park where 10 yera old told me I got in wrong, but in fact I had done it correctly.
