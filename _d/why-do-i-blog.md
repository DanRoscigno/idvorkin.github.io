To effectively share my thinking. I'll build my idea sharing muscle by:

1. Practicing thinking by writing.
1. Remembering, developing and sharing, my past thinking.
1. Defining, and holding my self accountable to "Why" I'm doing things.

My non goals in blogging:

- Build a personal brand
- Have a blog that can be read front to back
- Generate revenue from my blog.
