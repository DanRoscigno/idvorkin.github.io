Here's a tale [a friend with bipolar](https://breckyunits.com/a-manic-startup.html): What pains me most is I see how crystal clear my illness was in the beginning and how I was surrounded by so much love—so, so many family and friends were desperately trying to intervene—and I spurned them and then reacted despicably. I am so, so sorry. I failed as a husband, a father, son, brother, friend, as a kind human being. It is a hard pill to swallow that I was the Evil one, after all. Why did I fail? Me. My brain. My manic self. I wanted more than anything to prove them wrong. That I could do this. But I couldn't. You can learn a lot, but you can't unlearn bipolar disorder. I desperately wanted to believe that bipolar disorder wasn't real and that I could stop living in fear of it. That all the doubters were wrong.

### My experience with Mania

I've never taken cocaine, but I did go hypo-manic once, and it was glorious. Infinite energy, sharp as a whip, maximum creativity. Well, that's my subjective reality, but external observers said I was talking fast, jittery, etc. And of course, such high energy can go out of control, and it must be paid back with some future depression.

### Don't fool your self, this is as serious as depression

- [From Breck's Nasty Manic Episode](https://breckyunits.com/a-manic-startup.html)

Why did my startup fail? Me. My brain. My manic self. Someone once called me a terrible entrepreneur. I wanted more than anything to prove them wrong. That I could do this. But I couldn't. You can learn a lot about doing startups but you can't unlearn bipolar disorder.

I desperately wanted to believe that bipolar disorder wasn't real and that I could stop living in fear of it. That all the doubters were wrong and that we would build a new kind of scientific database that would prove this.

What pains me most is I see how crystal clear my illness was in the beginning and how I was surrounded by so much love—so, so many family and friends were desperately trying to intervene—and I spurned them and then reacted despicably. I am so, so sorry.

Far worse than failing at the startup I failed as a husband, a father, son, brother, friend, as a kind human being.

It is a hard pill to swallow that I was the Evil one, after all.

### The failure modes: Crash your car, spend all your money, have an affair.

**Crash your car** - I hate driving, I'm either riding a bicycle, or as of 2023, or my car is [driving me](/tesla). Safe

**Spend all your money** - Lucky for me, I'm pretty cheap, and basically own everything I want already.

**Have an affair** - This is my highest risk, luckily at the time I was in terrible shape, and now I know there is nothing more sacred then my family.
