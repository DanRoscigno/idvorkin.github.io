Here are words from a [a friend](https://breckyunits.com/a-manic-startup.html) I hope I never have to repeat myself: What pains me most is I see how crystal clear my illness was in the beginning and how I was surrounded by so much love—so, so many family and friends were desperately trying to intervene—and I spurned them and then reacted despicably. I am so, so sorry. I failed as a husband, a father, son, brother, friend, as a kind human being. It is a hard pill to swallow that I was the Evil one, after all. Why did I fail? Me. My brain. My manic self. I wanted more than anything to prove them wrong. That I could do this. But I couldn't. You can learn a lot, but you can't unlearn bipolar disorder. I desperately wanted to believe that bipolar disorder wasn't real and that I could stop living in fear of it. That all the doubters were wrong.

I've never taken cocaine, but I did go hypo-manic in 2012, and it was glorious. Infinite energy, sharp as a whip, maximum creativity. Well, that's my subjective reality, but external observers said I was talking fast, jittery, etc. And of course, such high energy can go out of control, and it must be paid back with some future depression.

### Don't fool your self, this is as serious as depression

- [From Breck's Nasty Manic Episode](https://breckyunits.com/a-manic-startup.html)

Why did my startup fail? Me. My brain. My manic self. Someone once called me a terrible entrepreneur. I wanted more than anything to prove them wrong. That I could do this. But I couldn't. You can learn a lot about doing startups but you can't unlearn bipolar disorder.

I desperately wanted to believe that bipolar disorder wasn't real and that I could stop living in fear of it. That all the doubters were wrong and that we would build a new kind of scientific database that would prove this.

What pains me most is I see how crystal clear my illness was in the beginning and how I was surrounded by so much love—so, so many family and friends were desperately trying to intervene—and I spurned them and then reacted despicably. I am so, so sorry.

Far worse than failing at the startup I failed as a husband, a father, son, brother, friend, as a kind human being.

It is a hard pill to swallow that I was the Evil one, after all.

### The failure modes: Crash your car, spend all your money, have an affair.

**Crash your car** - I hate driving, I'm either riding a bicycle, or as of 2023, or my car is [driving me](/tesla). Safe

**Spend all your money** - Lucky for me, I'm pretty cheap, and basically own everything I want already.

**Have an affair** - This is my highest risk, luckily at the time I was in terrible shape, and now I know there is nothing more sacred then my family.

### What you should do if you sense I'm going hypomanic

In the bipolar survival guide they say it's critical to make a plan for when you go off kilter while you're stable. So here's my plan:

- 1 - get me into a psychiatrist ASAP.
- 2 need to figure this out.
- 3 - make me read this
- 4 - check I'm still on meds

### My hypo mania in 2012

Cause

I had been diagnosed with depression, and went on SSRIs. I remember it clear as day about 12 weeks to the day of taking SSRIs we were driving back from Oregon (TBD: Find old blog post), and I suddenly felt fantastic.

I told my pychaitist (I'd only had him for 12 weeks), and he was like you need to stop SSRI's immediately, he also prescribed some valium in case symptoms got worse.

The episode:

I stabilized at high energy, for about 2 or 3 months

Stuff I did

- Poetry Class (link color blue was born)
- Poetry Slam (link slam)
- Very impressive strategy at work (link Manish inspiration post)
- Other ??

Interventions:

- Lamatrogine/Lamictal - for the rest of my life.

Post Episode:

- Did I become depressed don't recall.

### Optimal energy vs Hypomania

Sometimes, I'm at my best, and I wonder if I'm going hypomanic - so far the real condition seems to be how much sleep I need. As long as I get tired and need sleep, I'm probably just operating at my best, and feeling great for it.

### Hypomania vs Mania

I liked to use the word Mania with my pychiatrist, he scolded me, no you're not manic. Manic is different, and he told me a story.

Fished his client out of Lake Union in a wrestling leotard. What are you doing asked the police? Oh, I'm planning on pulling this tug boat.
