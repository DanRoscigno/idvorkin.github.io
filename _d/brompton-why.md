### How it brings my pleasure

*) Being able to take it on buses, subways, ubers, car2gos and people's trunks.
*) Being able to throw it in people's trunks
*) Riding it all the time
*) Looking goofy
*) All the people that ask me questions about it
*) Telling people to try riding it

###  The only improvements I can think of for the  Brompton:

1) More gears - the gear range is good enough, but having more than 6 gears would be so much more helpful.
2) A water bottle holder. For a bike that is perfect in every way, it's surpsing there is no water bottle holder.
