From creating a vision that inspires to laying out the strategies to get there, product work requires a range of skillsâ€”and a good dose of creativity. Putting the puzzle pieces together is essential to creating a product that appeals to its customers. With the right combination of vision, strategy, product design and execution, anyone can create something truly remarkable. With this in mind, let's start building the future we want to create!

## Product Work

### Product Vision - The future you want to create

Vision should be inspiring! Strategy should should be focused.

Top recruiting tools, motivates folks to come to work daily. Everyone wants to work on something meaningful. Don't know if, or how, you'll deliver the vision, but you should believe it's worth doing!

- Start with why
- Focus on the problem, not the solution
- Think really big
- Be OK disrupting yourself
- Inspire
- Embrace relevant trends
- Skate to where the puck is heading
- Stubborn on vision, flexible on details
- Realize it always is a leap of faith
- Evangalize continously

### Sharing your thinking/approach

- Connect work to goals
- Don't hide constraints (no designer/no eng/xyz)
- Show decisions by laying out your insights and reasoning
- Partner with designer other stakeholders

### Product Strategy - Path to get to the future

Vision should be inspiring! Strategy should should be focused.

Pleasing everyone pleases no one. So this is where we decide what we're going to do next. It's the sequence of products or releases to get to our vision.

- One target market or persona at a time
- Needs to align with business strategy
- Align with sales and go-to market strategy
- Obsess on customers not competitors
- Make sure all partners know your strategy

### Product Discovery (Solving the big risks)

The key of product discovery framing is:

1. Team is in sync on

   - The objective,
   - Problem we solve for the customers,
   - which target is the customers
   - How to know if we succeeded.
   - These are connected to the KPIs

1. The big risks are identified and tackled
   - Customer Risk - Will the customer buy it?
   - Usability Risk - Can user figure out how to use it?
   - Feasibility Risk - Can we build it?
   - Business Risk - Does this work for our business?

NOTE: The goal is to focus on the customers problem that is constant, the solution varies with the iterations

Some things as you try to eliminate these risks

1. Customers (and execs) can't tell you what to build
1. Most important thing is to provide value
1. User experience is usually harder than the engineering process
1. Design/Tech/Function is intertwined
1. Many of our ideas won't work and we require iteration
1. Must validate our ideas on real users
1. Goal is to validate as cheaply as possible
1. Validate business value during discovery, not after
1. Share learnings with the team.

### Working with Product Design

Product design is critical. Common Failure modes:

- PM tries to draw prodcuts themselves. Eng needs product design, you draw wireframes, eng builds, and makes up the design themselves
- PM doesn't provide designs, just stories, again eng makes up product design themselves
- You create interactive design, then hire a contractor to draw themselves

Optimal, having a designer:

- Do what is required to have them sit with you
- Include design from start of all ideas
- Include design in as many customer and user interactions as possible
- Don't give the desiner your ideas, let them sole the problems themselves.
- Let designer iterate as much as possible.

### How to prioritize your market

- Market Size - TAM
- The go to market plan for the segment (sales channel, advertising method, CAC)
- How long to build - Time to market

### Evangilism - How to sell the dream

- Use a prototype
- Show customer pain
- Repeate the product vision and the strategy
- Give lots of credit to all
- Give a great demo
- Be an expert on the domain (competitors, customers)
- Be excited - Enthusiasm is contaigous
- Spend time with the team - Every single person, makes a very big deal.

## Roadmapping and User Story Mapping

### What's a story map

## Concepts

### Engagement vs Growth

- Growth is getting new users - New entrypoints, advertising, etc - DAU/WAU/MAU
- Engagement - Getting existing users to have more value - Usage Time

### DAU is retention and new users

- Recall DAU needs new users returning users. New users vs retention likely matters in a

## Flywheels

_Huh, GPT is writing these_

### Sharing Flywheel

A Sharing Flywheel is a model or concept used to encourage the sharing of a particular piece of content with the intent of increasing its visibility and engagement. The basic idea is that if one person shares it, their followers or friends may reshare and repost the content, creating a "flywheel" effect where the content is shared and reshared in a cycle. By creating an environment where the content can become viral, more people will be exposed to it, which can lead to more engagement

### Content Consumption Flywheel

A Content Consumption Flywheel is a type of content marketing strategy in which a company or organization encourages their customers and followers to consume content in an ongoing cycle. This strategy encourages customers and followers to consume content consistently, often on a regular basis and

### Notes from the goal

The goal is a book that was mandatory reading for amazon executives...
_Might be worth it's own page_

3 Areas:

1. Making Money - What ever your output goal is. Though usuall you move an input goal.
2. Inventory - Stuff that's required to meet your goal, but isn't sufficient.
3. Operating Expense - Anyt costs.

Note, inventory is output. Not inherintly useful. Outcomes is goal!
