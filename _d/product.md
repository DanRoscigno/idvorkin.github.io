My notes on being a product manager

### Product Vision - The future you want to create

Vision should be inspiring! Strategy should should be focused.

Top recruiting tools, motivates folks to come to work daily. Everyone wants to work on something meaningful.  Don't know if, or how, you'll deliver the vision, but you should believe it's worth doing!

* Start with why
* Focus on the problem, not the solution
* Think really big
* Be OK disrupting yourself
* Inspire
* Embrace relevant trends
* Skate to where the puck is heading
* Stubborn on vision, flexible on details
* Realize it always is a leap of faith
* Evangalize continously

### Product Strategy - Path to get to the future

Vision should be inspiring! Strategy should should be focused.

Pleasing everyone pleases no one. So this is where we decide what we're going to do  next. It's the sequence of products or releases to get to our vision.


* One target market or persona at a time
* Needs to align with business strategy
* Align with sales and go-to market strategy
* Obsess on customers not competitors
* Make sure all partners know your strategy

### Product Discovery (Solving the big risks)

* Customer Risk - Will the customer buy it?
* Usability Risk - Can user figure out how to use it?
* Feasibility Risk - Can we build it?
* Business Risk - Does this work for our business?

Some things as you try to eliminate these risks

1. Customers (and execs) can't tell you what to build
1. Most important thing is to provide value
1. User experience is usually harder than the engineering process
1. Design/Tech/Function is intertwined
1. Many of our ideas won't work and we require iteration
1. Must validate our ideas on real users
1. Goal is to validate as cheaply as possible
1. Validate business value during discovery, not after
1. Share learnings with the team.

### Product Discovery Framing

The key of product discovery Framing is.


### User Story Mapping


### How to prioritize your market.

* Market Size - TAM
* The go to market plan for the segment (sales channel, advertising method, CAC)
* How long to build - Time to market


### Evangilism - How to sell the dream

* Use a prototype
* Show customer pain
* Repeate the product  vision and the strategy
* Give lots of credit to all
* Give a great demo
* Be an expert on the domain (competitors, customers)
* Be excited  - Enthusiasm is contaigous
* Spend time with the team - Every single person, makes a very big deal.


### Notes from the goal

The goal is a book that was mandatory reading for amazon executives...
*Might be worth it's own page*

3 Areas:

1/ Making Money - What ever your output goal is. Though usuall you move an input goal.
2/ Inventory - Stuff that's required to meet your goal, but isn't sufficient.
3/ Operating Expense - Anyt costs.

Note, inventory is output. Not inherintly useful. Outcomes is goal!
