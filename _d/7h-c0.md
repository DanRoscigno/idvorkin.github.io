### Inside Out

To change the situation, change ourselves
We transform from the inside out. Change how we think, then change how we act and how we succeed.

### Charector vs Personality Ethic

Our integrity, vs our salesman ship

### Pardigm - rabbit vs duck

### Subjective vs Objective - Carrier vs Lighthouse

### Thoughts, Actions, Habits, Charector, Life

### Depednant, Independant, Interdependant

Sow a thought, reap an action. Sow and action reap a habit, sow a habit, reap a charector, sow a charector rep our destiny.

### Effectiveness, P/PC Balance

My video in [balance](/balance)

### Assets: Physical, Financial, Human

### Map vs Terrain

### Teach others to teach yourself

### How we "see" the problem, because our subjective problem.

### Around and around - Feedback loop
