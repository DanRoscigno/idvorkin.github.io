# Sustainable work

## Why?

80/20 rule.
If you want to get more done,
Best motivator for good people.

## Example Behaviors

### No meetings after 4

### No mails on evenings and weekends

### Uninstall mail on vacations

### High quality mic/web cam for remote workers

### Vacation policy

"We don't track the time we spend working outside of the office-like e-mails we answer from home and the work we do at night and on weekends-so why do we track the time we spend off the job?"

A good [article](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/269989) on the value of unlimited vacation time.

## Business need to put in more hours.

The team has to put the business first, which means there are times you will have to work more hours. On-call, fire drills, and or urgent business deliverables. However, those should be the exception, and when they happen, I believe you should take lieu time.

## Organizational change

When I joined a new organization, I was amazed that at noon Friday a director called a meeting for 4pm-5pm on the same Friday.  The next Monday, I walked into the director's office and said "How much will I need to pay you to not have meetings after 4?" The director asked "Why?". I explained that I come in early, and like to leave by 4.  The director then asked "Hymn, should we have no meetings after 3?". I replied 4 should be fine, and that was that. No meetings after 4.

## FAQ

#### Your time off policy sounds great, but I want to write code

Building code muscles is great - I highly recomend it. I believe the best way to do that is to work on a side project or to take courses, and read a great programming book.

#### Really, you do this?

Like everyone else, my goals are aspirational and sometimes I miss. But I highly value feedback and expect my co-workers to hold me accountable when I'm not doing it.

#### How many hours do you work a week?

My goal is to work 40-50 hours. I will not check e-mail on the evenings or weekends, but I do spend a bunch of time on professional development like coding side projects and reading books on emotional intelligence.


#### What's a typical work day?

I'm a morning person, and like to roll out of bed at 5am and start working by 5:30. I try to get in 2 hour block from 5:30-7:30am. At 7:30 I walk my son to school, then bike to work.  I'm at work by 9am, and then work till 4pm.  Once I leave, I'm strict about unplugging. Unless there's a fire, I will not check e-mail or work from home. Because this has me working 45 hours/week, I have no guilt leaving in the middle of the day for my daughters dance performances, or to catch up with a friend who's visiting town.

#### Have you ever burned out?

Yes. I've burned out 3 times in my career. The first time, I just became a senior developor, just had my first child, and just bought my first house.  The second time, I put my team in a position where they were setup for failure, and I didn't know how to declare success and move on. The third time, I didn't realize I was operating under extremly unrealistic expecations and didn't have support structure I needed.

#### Man this sounds awesome, but my boss has me completely overloaded.

That's a hard position. My thoughts on task overload are [here](http://ig2600.blogspot.com/search?q=overload).

#### Did you always do this?

No, when I was young and single, I wanted to build my tech muslces as fast as I could and often worked 50-60 hours a week. When I started Azure, I and the entire team worked 60 hours a week, and it was one of the funest times in my career.

#### I'm young and single - I want to work like a dog - should I?

Sure! That's what I did. If you want to do this, you're welcome in my team, but I'd recommend doing it in a team that is all working like a dog, you'll have more fun!
