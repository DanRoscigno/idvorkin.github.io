Who is the audience?
    - Igor
    - People I'm looking to recruit to my team.
    - People on my team who can hold me accountable to my aspirations
    - My future employers who want to build this culture
    - My current boss who is trying ot figure out what is going on.
    - PART 2: My future employers that want to know why I'm doing this, and my strategies.

What are the 3 thing they should remember
    - Work life balance is crucial
    - Work life balance takes work.
    - Igor will prioritize and model good work life balance

Why does Igor need a reminder?
    - Work centered
    - If don't put in mechanisms, will just work like a dog.
    - If working in an unsustainable manner will burn out
    - Need to set and remember my boundaries

XXX: What is the call to action?

<!-- Why? On your death bed -->

Imagine being on your deathbed, having one of your final conversations with your grown up child before your eyes close for the last time. When they ask you about your biggest greatest regrets do you want to answer: "I wished I spent less time at work ", "I wish I'd spent more time with my family", "I wish I'd taken care of my health"?

I don't, and I bet you don't either.

The people I want to work with value a culture encouraging them to balance their family, health, hobbies and work - aka work life balance. For a culture to be real, the leadership team needs walk the talk, and I'll describe how I role model work life balance, and the mechanisms I put in place to encourage balance in my teams.

In a future post, I'll describe how you can build a culture of work life balance into an organization that only gives it lip service.

### How do I achieve work life balance

Organizations reflect their leaders, and I try my best to model sustainability. Here are some of my personal behaviors:

-   Leave every day at 4, and don't touch work evenings and weekends.
-   I don't have work e-mail on my phone.
-   Sneak out mid day to get to events that are important to my children.
-   Take lieu time if I've been putting in too many hours at work in the short term.
-   (Use planning to know if there will be work spikes ahead of time to let my family know)

### What mechanisms do I put in place to enable a culture of work life balance.

High performing organizations use structural mechanisms to support the culture. Here are some mechanisms I put in place :

-   To support working remotely, have chat rooms, high quality microphones, and meetings with video conferencing capabilities.
-   To ensure people can go home guilt free, have no meetings after 4.
-   To encourage people to take care of themselves, have an [unlimited vacation policy](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/269989) including taking extra days off during the holidays.
-   To avoid people getting stressed out by a mail from their boss, I don't send e-mails on weekends or evenings.
-   To teach the behavior, I make work life balance a top priority.

To flesh out:

-   Planning
-   Defending Boundaries
-   Managing up
-   No meetings after 4

### The fine print

-   Like all hard goals, there are times where I slip up, and don't live up to my standards. If you see me doing this, call me out, and I'll do my best to course correct.
-   There are times when we need to swing work life balance to work. But they should be rare, clear ahead of time, and followed or proceeded by times where you can focus on your life.
-   Changing culture is a slow process so if I'm new to an organization expect a while for it to kick in.

### Organizational change (Sneak peek of post #2)

Skeptical people expect these processes will be abused, but in all the teams I've instituted it's never been a problem. If anything, it encourages a high performing team by encouraging the team to cover each other when folks want time off.

#### Telling boss to stop having meetings after 4

When I joined a new organization, I was amazed that at noon Friday a director called a meeting for 4pm-5pm on the same Friday. The next Monday, I walked into the director's office and said "How much will I need to pay you to not have meetings after 4?" The director asked "Why?". I explained that I come in early, and like to leave by 4. The director then asked "Hymn, should we have no meetings after 3?". I replied 4 should be fine, and that was that. No meetings after 4.

### FAQ

#### Your time off policy sounds great, but I want to write code

Building code muscles is great - I highly recommend it. I believe the best way to do that is to work on a side project or to take courses, and read a great programming book.

#### Sounds like I'm working less, how will this impact my career

80/20 rule
But, if someone is equally efficient and working more hours, their career might go faster, but in my experience unsustaible, miserable, burn out.

#### Really, you do this

Like everyone else, my goals are aspirational and sometimes I miss. But I highly value feedback and expect my co-workers to hold me accountable when I'm not doing it.

#### How many hours do you work a week

My goal is to work 40-50 hours. I will not check e-mail on the evenings or weekends, but I do spend a bunch of time on professional development like coding side projects and reading books on emotional intelligence.

#### What's a typical work day

I'm a morning person, and like to roll out of bed at 5am and start working by 5:30. I try to get in 2 hour block from 5:30-7:30am. At 7:30 I walk my son to school, then bike to work. I'm at work by 9am, and then work till 4pm. Once I leave, I'm strict about unplugging. Unless there's a fire, I will not check e-mail or work from home. Because this has me working 45 hours/week, I have no guilt leaving in the middle of the day for my daughters dance performances, or to catch up with a friend who's visiting town.

#### Have you ever burned out

Yes. I've burned out 3 times in my career. The first time, I just became a senior developer, just had my first child, and just bought my first house. The second time, I put my team in a position where they were setup for failure, and I didn't know how to declare success and move on. The third time, I didn't realize I was operating under extremely unrealistic expectations and didn't have support structure I needed.

#### Man this sounds awesome, but my boss has me completely overloaded

That's a hard position. My thoughts on task overload are [here](http://ig2600.blogspot.com/search?q=overload).

#### Did you always do this

No, when I was young and single, I wanted to build my tech muscles as fast as I could and often worked 50-60 hours a week. When I started Azure, I and the entire team worked 60 hours a week, and it was one of the most fun times in my career.

#### I'm young and single - I want to work like a dog - should I

Sure! That's what I did. If you want to do this, you're welcome in my team, but I'd recommend doing it in a team that is all working like a dog, you'll have more fun!
