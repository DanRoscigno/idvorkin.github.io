<!-- Why? On your death bed -->

Imagine being on your deathbed, in one of the last conversations you'll ever have with your grown up child. Notice the heaviness in your heart as you describe your regrets. Do you want those regrets to include "I wish I spent less time at work ", "I wish I spent more time with my family", "I wish I made time to take care of my health"?

I don't, and I bet you don't either.

The people I want to work with value a culture encouraging them to balance their family, health, hobbies and work - aka work life balance. For a culture to be real, the leadership team needs walk the talk, and I'll describe how I role model work life balance, and the mechanisms I put in place to encourage balance in my teams.

In a future post, I'll describe how you can build a culture of work life balance into an organization that only gives it lip service.

### How do I model work life balance

Organizations reflect their leaders, and I try my best to model sustainability. Here are some of my personal behaviors:

**I leave at 4 pm, 4 days a week** My watch alarm goes off every day at 3:45pm, reminding me to wrap up for the day. It goes off a second time at 4:05, at which point I drop what I'm doing, grab my bag, and leave. I do this 4 days a week like clockwork. One day a week I'll stay late, usually with an open schedule. I do this because many people prefer to socialize around 4-6, and I want to be around for that - aka happy hour!

**I don't work evenings and weekends** I love my job when it's going well, and I have a huge sense of responsibility when it's going poorly. If I don't force myself to stop working, I won't. Thus, I have a simple rule which I stick to most of the time - don't work evening and weekends. There are exceptions when I want/need to work an evening or weekend, when that happens I'm religious about using delayed send to avoid my employees getting mails from me out of business hours.

**I don't have work e-mail on my phone** When I say I don't work on evenings and weekends I mean I don't work evenings and weekends and e-mail is work. If I had work e-mail on my phone I'd check it when I'm idle, so I can't have work e-mail from my phone. I do have chime (aka Skype/Slack/Teams)) in case something is urgent and folks want to get a hold of me.

**I proudly go to kids events during the day** My daughter is 4, the highlight of her life is her "ballet recital" it's the 3rd Wednesday every 4 months @ 11am. I won't miss it for the world.

**I book my vacations in advance, I take them, and I keep my work laptop off** Every year my mom comes for spring break, we visit my wife's family for a week around thanksgiving, we take a week in the summer to visit my sister in Canada, and we take some time to enjoy the kids being off school for winter break. As hard as it is to let go of work (and trust me it's way hard), I say sorry - this vacation is booked, I won't be available till I'm back from vacation.

### How do we make it easier to to achieve work life balance on this team

Work life balance requires organizational mechanisms, and here are some of ours.

_Still rough_

**Realistic Expectations** Anxiety is the difference between expectations and reality, and to leave work you need to have realistic expectations. We achieve this by continuously adjusting what is realistic, rebalancing resources,

-   Laws of physics win
-   Continuous assessment of realistic.
-   We work out priority, you figure out cost and we agree on cut line.
-   Golden triangle
-   Re-prioritize, re-assign resources
-   Examples slipping

**Flexible work hours** Everyone achieves work life balance differently, so we allow you to have flexible hours. But everyone says this, so here are some mechanisms we apply :

-   Work where/when you want to -- remote work/results vs time oriented
-   To ensure people can go home guilt free, have no meetings after 4.
    E.g. Sarah taking care of her child.

**Remote work** Who wants to work from the office? Everyone says this but, we have high quality microphones in our scrum area, we use slack,

_This could merge, but explicitly not merging to enable a quick skim as folks want this_
E.g. Sarah work remotely

-   To support working remotely, have chat rooms, high quality microphones, and meetings with video conferencing capabilities.

**Unlimited Time off**

High performing organizations use structural mechanisms to support the culture. Here are some mechanisms I put in place:

-   To encourage people to take care of themselves, have an [unlimited vacation policy](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/269989) including taking extra days off during the holidays.

**Team events** (Feedback on if this should be in a separate blog post) Work life balance shouldn't be limited to outside of work, we do team breakfasts, Friday afternoon beers and folks eat lunch together? (This is a place I need to get stronger)

### The fine print

-   Like all hard goals, there are times where I slip up, and don't live up to my standards. If you see me doing this, call me out, and I'll do my best to course correct.
-   There are times when we need to swing work life balance to work. But they should be rare, clear ahead of time, and followed or proceeded by times where you can focus on your life.
-   Changing culture is a slow process so if I'm new to an organization expect a while for it to kick in.

### How do I manage up to enable work life balance (Sneak peek of post #2)

This topic is worthy of its own blog post, and it will get it. In the interim, here are a few examples of me going to bat for work life balance.

**The Friday at 4 meetings**

**The team event**

**The mandatory vacation**

**Blocking shipping**

Stories:

-   Telling boss to stop having meetings after 4

When I joined a new organization, I was amazed that at noon Friday a director called a meeting for 4pm-5pm on the same Friday. The next Monday, I walked into the director's office and said "How much will I need to pay you to not have meetings after 4?" The director asked "Why?". I explained that I come in early, and like to leave by 4. The director then asked "Hymn, should we have no meetings after 3?". I replied 4 should be fine, and that was that. No meetings after 4.

-   Erica - Boat day at Sean's time off
-   Team breakfasts -- too long, too often
-   Don't want to go, I do it anyways
-   Less capacity on holiday weekends
-   Too much ambiguity for top down planning. Rebuild roadmap on fly
-   Shipping is a feature
-   9 Woman in 1 month do not a baby make
-   Real schedule, management schedule, happy to do both

### FAQ

#### Your time off policy sounds great, but I want to write code

Building code muscles is great - I highly recommend it. I believe the best way to do that is to work on a side project or to take courses, and read a great programming book.

#### Sounds like I'm working less, how will this impact my career

80/20 rule
But, if someone is equally efficient and working more hours, their career might go faster, but in my experience unsustainable, miserable, burn out.

#### Really, you do this

Like everyone else, my goals are aspirational and sometimes I miss. But I highly value feedback and expect my co-workers to hold me accountable when I'm not doing it.

#### How many hours do you work a week

My goal is to work 40-50 hours. I will not check e-mail on the evenings or weekends, but I do spend a bunch of time on professional development like coding side projects and reading books on emotional intelligence.

#### What's a typical work day

I'm a morning person, and like to roll out of bed at 5am and start working by 5:30. I try to get in 2 hour block from 5:30-7:30am. At 7:30 I walk my son to school, then bike to work. I'm at work by 9am, and then work till 4pm. Once I leave, I'm strict about unplugging. Unless there's a fire, I will not check e-mail or work from home. Because this has me working 45 hours/week, I have no guilt leaving in the middle of the day for my daughters dance performances, or to catch up with a friend who's visiting town.

#### Have you ever burned out

Yes. I've burned out 3 times in my career. The first time, I just became a senior developer, just had my first child, and just bought my first house. The second time, I put my team in a position where they were setup for failure, and I didn't know how to declare success and move on. The third time, I didn't realize I was operating under extremely unrealistic expectations and didn't have support structure I needed.

#### Man this sounds awesome, but my boss has me completely overloaded

That's a hard position. My thoughts on task overload are [here](http://ig2600.blogspot.com/search?q=overload).

#### Did you always do this

No, when I was young and single, I wanted to build my tech muscles as fast as I could and often worked 50-60 hours a week. When I started Azure, I and the entire team worked 60 hours a week, and it was one of the most fun times in my career.

#### I'm young and single - I want to work like a dog - should I

Sure! That's what I did. If you want to do this, you're welcome in my team, but I'd recommend doing it in a team that is all working like a dog, you'll have more fun!
