Who is the audience?
    - People I'm looking to recruit to my team.
    - People on my team who can hold me accountable to my aspirations
    - Igor
    - My future employers who want to build this culture
    - My current boss who is trying to figure out what is going on.
    - PART 2: My future employers that want to know why I'm doing this, and my strategies.

What are the 3 thing they should remember
    - Work life balance is crucial
    - Work life balance takes work.
    - Igor will prioritize and model good work life balance

How do I prove it?
    - Everyone says they do it - but how to prove?
    - Give examples of people doing it.
    - Show mechanisms of how.


Why does Igor need a reminder?
    - Work centered
    - If don't put in mechanisms, will just work like a dog.
    - If working in an unsustainable manner will burn out
    - Need to set and remember my boundaries

Sean's alternate intro:

Work life balance is a spectrum from working all of your waking hours to working the minimum you can get away with. You'll be happiest when you find a team who lands on the spectrum where you want to.  I love my job, but want to limit my work to 45 hours/week.  I don't want regrets like "X", "Y", "Z"

-->

<!-- Why? On your death bed -->

Imagine being on your deathbed, having one of your last conversations with your child.  Do you want to be saying "I wish I spent less time at work ", "I wish I spent more time with my family", "I wish I made time to take care of my health"?

I don't, and I bet you don't either.

The people I want to work with value a culture encouraging them to balance their family, health, hobbies and work - aka work life balance. For a culture to be real, the leadership team needs walk the talk, and I'll describe how I role model work life balance, and the mechanisms I use to help the team achieve balance.


### How do I model work life balance

Organizations reflect their leaders, and I strive to model work life balance.

**I leave at 4 pm, 4 days a week** My watch alarm goes off every day at 3:45pm, reminding me to wrap up for the day. It goes off a second time at 4:05, at which point I drop what I'm doing, grab my bag, and leave. I do this 4 days a week like clockwork. One day a week I stay late, usually with an open schedule. I do this because many people prefer to socialize around 4-6, and I want to be around for that - aka happy hour!

**I don't work evenings and weekends** I love my job when it's going well, and I have a huge sense of responsibility when it's going poorly. If I don't force myself to stop working, I won't. Thus, I have a rule - don't work evening and weekends. There are exceptions when I want/need to work an evening or weekend, when that happens I'm religious about using delayed send to avoid my employees getting mails from me out of business hours.

**I don't have work e-mail on my phone** When I say I don't work on evenings and weekends I mean I don't work evenings and weekends and e-mail is work. When I have work e-mail on my phone I check it when I'm idle, so I don't have work e-mail on my phone. I do have chime (aka Skype/Slack/Teams) in case my team needs anything from me.

**I proudly go to kids events during the day** My daughter is 4, the highlight of her life is her "ballet recital" it's the 3rd Wednesday every 4 months @ 11am. I won't miss it for the world.

**I book my vacations in advance, I take them, and I keep my work laptop off** Every year my mom comes for spring break, we visit my wife's family for a week around thanksgiving, we take a week in the summer to visit my sister in Canada, and we take some time to enjoy the kids being off school for winter break. As hard as it is to let go of work (and trust me it's way hard), I say sorry - this vacation is booked, I won't be available till I'm back from vacation.

### How do we make it easier to to achieve work life balance on my team

Work life balance requires organizational mechanisms and care, here are some of ours.

**Unlimited paid time off** To encourage people to take care of themselves, we have [unlimited time off](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/269989). Some people take advantage of this naturally, but others require encouragement. For example, this year July 4th was a Wednesday, so I removed two days of capacity from everyone's sprint and told them to be "sick" either Monday/Tuesday or Thursday/Friday. As another example, when folks do an internal transfer into my team I encourage them to take a few weeks off to refresh and reset.

**Realistic expectations for work deliverables** To enjoy your time off work you need to be free of anxiety. Because anxiety is the difference between expectations and reality my top priority is making sure everyone is thinking realistically.  This is a huge topic, so I'only skim the surface in a single dimension - unrealistic thoughts people have in their mind.

Folks develop unrealistic expectations around tasks they can't deliver and they can spiral into negative thoughts like "I should be able to do this", "Any one else can do this", "I need to work more hours",  "I'm letting the team down", "my project will fail", "I'm failing", or worst of all "I'm a failure".

As the manager I have a better view of reality, common realities include:  your deliverables are harder then expected, you haven't yet built the skills to complete the tasks and you're having some unexpected life events that you should deal with.

Because folks tend to be embarrassed about these thoughts I keep my eyes open for employees being stressed, working lots of hours, and not operating at their normal performance.

When I spot this happening, I jump in remind the person that I know they're good, they're doing the best they can, and we'll get this under control. I also remind them that if anyone on the team needed help, they'd jump in, and likewise, the team will do the same for them.  Once we've got the employees expectations corrected, we figure out the right way to get the project back on track.

**Flexible hours from wherever want to be** Everyone achieves work life balance differently, so the team does everything we can think of to make it easier to watch your daughter's soccer game, get your car to the mechanic, or go for an afternoon jog. For example, all our meetings are between 10 and 4, we use group messenger (Slack/Chime) heavily, we have meetings in rooms with video conferencing, and we have high quality microphones for ad-hoc conversations like stand up. I work remotely at least once a month, so if the experience sucks, I can prod the team to fix it.

**Making work like having a blast with your friends** Work you look forward to work is a top priority for me and I'll have several posts on the topic. The first post, [making memorable moments at work](https://idvorkin.github.io/moments-at-work) is in progress.

**Treating you like the human you are** I'm deeply offended when managers think developers are fungible resources assessed as the sum of their deliverables. I fundamentally believe developers are people first and need to be treated as such.

I genuinely appreciate everyone's contributions, and share my appreciation often.  I know mails from bosses are stressful so I don't send e-mails evenings and weekends. I know life comes first, so any time an employee says "I need to", I cut them off and say "Yes". Then I hear them, and remind them the team has their back (and now I can tell them they should read this post).

I experience deep satisfaction knowing I'm helping you achieve your goals, be they getting a promotion, getting a job in another team, or dialing back your work contributions so you can focus on a house remodel. To learn each team members unique aspirations, goals, skills, and preferences I make sure 1:1's are not status reports but opportunities to build our trust and relationship through valuable discussions.

### Veronica's Story

Veronica, a new mom on our team, heard about my post, and asked if she could share her experiences. In her own words:

The email from Igor read: "I've been noticing a lot of late night commits from you -- everything okay?"  I had to admit, I'd been staying up later than I would have liked working on our current project, since I was struggling to find uninterrupted time for coding during daylight hours.  Working from home with my newborn saved me time commuting and stress from daycare, but baby-tending was proving more of a handful than I had anticipated.  At the same time, although I was more excited about my work than I had been at any other time in my career, I was taken aback at how much I enjoyed spending time with my tiny human, and the desire I felt to drop everything else and do more with him.

Up until Igor's email made me examine my current work-life unbalance, I had a good track record of advocating for myself to ensure my success.  I negotiated working from home full time so I could skip my soul sucking commute and have more time with my son. Even as the only one working remotely full time, I felt very much a part of the teams, as meetings were scheduled in rooms with video capabilities so I could participate. Questions to team members were answered quickly and often led to an calls with screen sharing.  These feelings of inclusion extended to the org at large through personal recognition at all-hands meetings.  From my perspective, I was already so, so, accommodated - what more could I possibly expect to help me feel like my situation was sustainable and setup for success?

I don't think I would have ever had a conversation with Igor about how difficult I was finding it to manage my work and my life if he hadn't sent that email.  Firstly, I found it embarrassing to admit I was managing anything less than perfectly, and secondly, I didn't have a clear idea of what I could ask for that would improve my situation.  Looking back, this "suffer in silence" approach had me on a path to quietly and quickly burning out and leaving my team when I inevitably decided I just couldn't do both work and childcare.

Luckily, Igor did reach out and we did have a conversation about changes I could make, and places where the team could step up and help me accomplish my tasks in manageable way.  The most immediately impactful was reducing my carrying capacity during sprint planning.  I could still be responsible for the same tasks, we were just able, as a team, to understand the length of time it would reasonably take for me to get the tasks done without working long nights.  Reducing my load in such a way is never something I would have thought of asking for,  and is exactly why having this conversations is so important.  I didn't know there were options on the table, and a good manager (and good team mates) can help find these options.  This first conversation was a springboard for many subsequent conversations. Igor wanted me to have good guides for these decisions so he connected me with several women in his network - some working moms, some stayed at home, all from various industries.

While we had a great short-term solution, my son wasn't becoming any less demanding, and my desire to pivot to a full-time mom role wasn't wavering. I needed to start thinking about what I wanted to do in the long-term.  My reduced hours - and by extension, reduced stress - had the added benefit of giving me extra mental energy to think about what my coming decisions would mean for my son and me, and gave me a good idea of what sort of balance I could expect if I transitioned to being a part-time employee.  Ultimately, I decided to take a few years off while my son was young; I don't get to be his whole world for long so I'm really trying to soak that up!

### The fine print
**There are times where I slip up, and don't live up to my standards** If you see me doing this, call me out, and I'll do my best to course correct.

**There are times when work life balance swings to work**. They should be rare, clear ahead of time, and followed or proceeded by times where we can focus on our lives.

**Changing culture is a slow process** so when I'm new to an organization expect a while for it to kick in.

### How do I manage up to enable work life balance (Sneak peek of post #2)

This topic is worthy of its own blog post, and it will get it. In the interim, here are a few examples of me going to bat for work life balance.

**The Friday at 4 meetings**
**The team event**
**The mandatory vacation**
**Blocking shipping**

When I joined a new organization, I was amazed that at noon Friday a director called a meeting for 4pm-5pm on the same Friday. The next Monday, I walked into the director's office and said "How much will I need to pay you to not have meetings after 4?" The director asked "Why?". I explained that I come in early, and like to leave by 4. The director then asked "Hymn, should we have no meetings after 3?". I replied 4 should be fine, and that was that. No meetings after 4.

-   Team breakfasts too long, too often
-   Don't want to go, I do it anyways
-   Less capacity on holiday weekends
-   Too much ambiguity for top down planning. Rebuild roadmap on fly
-   Shipping is a feature
-   9 Woman in 1 month do not a baby make
-   Real schedule, management schedule, happy to do both

### FAQ

**How many hours do you work a week?** My goal is 40-50. I will not work evenings or weekends, but I do spend time on professional development like coding side projects and reading leadership books. An important note - I don't ask my team how much they work, I ask them what they accomplished.

**Have you ever burned out?** Yes. I've burned out 3 times in my career. The first time, I just became a senior developer, just had my first child, and just bought my first house. The second time, I put my team in a position where they were setup for failure, and I didn't know how to declare success and move on. The third time, I didn't realize I was operating under extremely unrealistic expectations and didn't have support structure I needed. I'll go into details on these situations in future blog posts.

**Your time off policy sounds great, but I want to write code non stop!** Building code muscles (or any skill) is great - I highly recommend it. I believe the best way to do that is to work on a side project, take courses, or read great programming books. You'll still get to code, but you'll do so and  broadenen your horizons.

**I'm young and single - I want to work like a dog - should I?** You can, that's what I did at the start of my career. If you want to do this, choose your team carefully and make sure the folks working like a dog are actually getting more work done and not on a path to burn out.

**Sounds like I'm working less, how will this impact my career/bonus?** If someone works as effectively as you for 60 hours a week, when you're working 40 hours a week, they'll get ahead. However, what I often see is the folks working 60 hours, are less effective with their time, and often burn out.

**What happens when the larger organization doesn't value work life balance** I'll go into this in detail in my blog post on organizational change. In short, in some organizations a significant fraction of people have no life, and it's literally going to cost you to have one yourself.  If that's not your cup of tea, that's not the organization for you.

I feel like you're maybe missing some acknowledgement that an organization/team-at-large can be either antagonistic or supportive at a very high level. This can be because the CEO expects it of everyone (think Bill or Bezos), or because your skip level doesn't respect his own time or anyone else's. But even somewhere like AMZN or MSFT, the opposite can also be true. I had a PUM on .NET who was incredibly protective of people's personal time, and never once passed on the directives from on high to "work nights & weekends". The main area you can't avoid this is when there's some semi-local stack-rank, because if a significant fraction of people have no life, it's literally going to cost you to have one yourself. Overall, though, good write-up!

**Did you always do this?** No, when I was young and single, I wanted to build my tech muscles as fast as I could and often worked 50-60 hours a week. When I started Azure, the entire team worked 60+ hours a week, and it was one of the most fun times in my career.

**Man this sounds awesome, but my boss has me completely overloaded!** That's a hard position. My thoughts on task overload are in [draft](http://ig2600.blogspot.com/search?q=overload).

    - How do I make sure the team is actually keeping work life balance?
    - Is there a penalty for only wokring 40 hours?
