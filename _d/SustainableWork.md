<!--
Who is the audience?
    - People I'm looking to recruit to my team.
    - People on my team who can hold me accountable to my aspirations
    - Igor
    - My future employers who want to build this culture
    - My current boss who is trying to figure out what is going on.
    - PART 2: My future employers that want to know why I'm doing this, and my strategies.

What are the 3 thing they should remember
    - Work life balance is crucial
    - Work life balance takes work.
    - Igor will prioritize and model good work life balance

How do I prove it?
    - Everyone says they do it - but how to prove?
    - Give examples of people doing it.
    - Show mechanisms of how.


Why does Igor need a reminder?
    - Work centered
    - If don't put in mechanisms, will just work like a dog.
    - If working in an unsustainable manner will burn out
    - Need to set and remember my boundaries

XXX: What is the call to action?

<!-- Why? On your death bed -->

Imagine being on your deathbed, having one of your final conversations with your grown up child. Feel your shoulders tense as you describe your regrets. Do you want to be saying "I wish I spent less time at work ", "I wish I spent more time with my family", "I wish I made time to take care of my health"?

I don't, and I bet you don't either.

The people I want to work with value a culture encouraging them to balance their family, health, hobbies and work - aka work life balance. For a culture to be real, the leadership team needs walk the talk, and I'll describe how I role model work life balance, and the mechanisms I put in place to encourage balance in my teams.

In a future post, I'll describe how you can build a culture of work life balance into an organization that only gives it lip service.

### How do I model work life balance

Organizations reflect their leaders, and I try my best to model sustainability. Here are some of my personal behaviors:

**I leave at 4 pm, 4 days a week** My watch alarm goes off every day at 3:45pm, reminding me to wrap up for the day. It goes off a second time at 4:05, at which point I drop what I'm doing, grab my bag, and leave. I do this 4 days a week like clockwork. One day a week I'll stay late, usually with an open schedule. I do this because many people prefer to socialize around 4-6, and I want to be around for that - aka happy hour!

**I don't work evenings and weekends** I love my job when it's going well, and I have a huge sense of responsibility when it's going poorly. If I don't force myself to stop working, I won't. Thus, I have a simple rule which I stick to most of the time - don't work evening and weekends. There are exceptions when I want/need to work an evening or weekend, when that happens I'm religious about using delayed send to avoid my employees getting mails from me out of business hours.

**I don't have work e-mail on my phone** When I say I don't work on evenings and weekends I mean I don't work evenings and weekends and e-mail is work. If I had work e-mail on my phone I'd check it when I'm idle, so I can't have work e-mail from my phone. I do have chime (aka Skype/Slack/Teams)) in case something is urgent and folks want to get a hold of me.

**I proudly go to kids events during the day** My daughter is 4, the highlight of her life is her "ballet recital" it's the 3rd Wednesday every 4 months @ 11am. I won't miss it for the world.

**I book my vacations in advance, I take them, and I keep my work laptop off** Every year my mom comes for spring break, we visit my wife's family for a week around thanksgiving, we take a week in the summer to visit my sister in Canada, and we take some time to enjoy the kids being off school for winter break. As hard as it is to let go of work (and trust me it's way hard), I say sorry - this vacation is booked, I won't be available till I'm back from vacation.

### How do we make it easier to to achieve work life balance on this team

Work life balance requires organizational mechanisms and care, and here are some of ours. I'll use some real examples from the last few months, with names and events changed to protect the innocent.

**Realistic Expectations** Anxiety is the difference between expectations and reality, and to leave work at work, you need to walk out the door stress free. This has two dimensions: 1) The business has realistic expectations that are updated as soon as facts on the ground change 2) individuals having assignments that are challenging but still within their ability and knowing the team has their back.

The business will never be surprised because it expects a continuous refinement of estimates based on our knowledge at the time. For example, my team was slated to implement video compression, and we assigned Jeb to work on the feature. His initial estimate was based on the fact a library existed that should allow us

We expected to be a small task given a video compression plugin already existed for our platform. After our initial investigation <blah>

Individuals will have assignments that are within their reach. We don't have a specific mechanism for this, but let me tell a story that illustrates a common situation.

For example, we found a bug in video upload that only affected Android devices. We thought it should be trivial, so I assigned Jeff an SDE I on the team to figure it out and fix it.  Four days in I was tipped off that Jeff had been working 14 hours since the start trying to figure it out, and in chatting with him it was clear the bug was much harder then we expected, and

fix what we thought was a simple  Android specific bug that would take a few days.  Because the bug was much harder then expected, the team member was working long hours trying to fix it, but it was outside of their ability. I explained to the employee the problem wasn't the employee but the complexity of the bug.  I re-assigned someone from a lower priority project to help the first engineer fix the problem

-   Laws of physics win
-   Continuous assessment of realistic.
-   We work out priority, you figure out cost and we agree on cut line.
-   Golden triangle
-   Re-prioritize, re-assign resources
-   Examples slipping

**Flexible work hours** Everyone achieves work life balance differently, so we allow you to have flexible hours.

An example of people working flexible hours was Sally, who had a 1 year old child, and wanted to work from home to be able  (blah)

- No meetings after 4.
-   Work where/when you want to -- remote work/results vs time oriented
-   To ensure people can go home guilt free, have no meetings after 4.
    E.g. Sarah taking care of her child.

**Remote work** Why be limited to working in the office?  Many folks want to work from home, or a plane, or from another country, and I'm all for it! A few examples of things we do to enable this are, heavy use of group messenger (Slack/Chime/etc), meetings in rooms with Video conferencing, having high quality microphones for ad-hoc group conversations. I tend to work from home a day or so every few weeks, so I get to experience the pain if our working from home experience isn't good enough.

**Unlimited Time off** To encourage people to take care of themselves, we have [unlimited time off](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/269989). Some people are willing to take advantage of this on their own, but many folks require encouragement :) For example, this year July 4th was a Wednesday, so I told folks I expected them to be "sick" either Monday and Tuesday or Thursday and Friday. As another example, when folks transfer internally into the team I encourage them to take a few weeks off as there are so few opportunities to take time off with a completely clear head.

**Team events (aka soul)** Building a team with soul is a huge part of my job, and I'll have a separate post on the topic, but as a preview, here's me the day I came to work in a rainbow suit.

### The fine print

-   Like all hard goals, there are times where I slip up, and don't live up to my standards. If you see me doing this, call me out, and I'll do my best to course correct.
-   There are times when we need to swing work life balance to work. But they should be rare, clear ahead of time, and followed or proceeded by times where you can focus on your life.
-   Changing culture is a slow process so if I'm new to an organization expect a while for it to kick in.

### How do I manage up to enable work life balance (Sneak peek of post #2)

This topic is worthy of its own blog post, and it will get it. In the interim, here are a few examples of me going to bat for work life balance.

**The Friday at 4 meetings**

**The team event**

**The mandatory vacation**

**Blocking shipping**

<!--
When I joined a new organization, I was amazed that at noon Friday a director called a meeting for 4pm-5pm on the same Friday. The next Monday, I walked into the director's office and said "How much will I need to pay you to not have meetings after 4?" The director asked "Why?". I explained that I come in early, and like to leave by 4. The director then asked "Hymn, should we have no meetings after 3?". I replied 4 should be fine, and that was that. No meetings after 4.

-   Erica - Boat day at Sean's time off
-   Team breakfasts too long, too often
-   Don't want to go, I do it anyways
-   Less capacity on holiday weekends
-   Too much ambiguity for top down planning. Rebuild roadmap on fly
-   Shipping is a feature
-   9 Woman in 1 month do not a baby make
-   Real schedule, management schedule, happy to do both

### FAQ

#### Your time off policy sounds great, but I want to write code

Building code muscles is great - I highly recommend it. I believe the best way to do that is to work on a side project or to take courses, and read a great programming book.

#### Sounds like I'm working less, how will this impact my career

80/20 rule
But, if someone is equally efficient and working more hours, their career might go faster, but in my experience unsustainable, miserable, burn out.

#### Really, you do this

Like everyone else, my goals are aspirational and sometimes I miss. But I highly value feedback and expect my co-workers to hold me accountable when I'm not doing it.

#### How many hours do you work a week

My goal is to work 40-50 hours. I will not check e-mail on the evenings or weekends, but I do spend a bunch of time on professional development like coding side projects and reading books on emotional intelligence.

#### What's a typical work day

I'm a morning person, and like to roll out of bed at 5am and start working by 5:30. I try to get in 2 hour block from 5:30-7:30am. At 7:30 I walk my son to school, then bike to work. I'm at work by 9am, and then work till 4pm. Once I leave, I'm strict about unplugging. Unless there's a fire, I will not check e-mail or work from home. Because this has me working 45 hours/week, I have no guilt leaving in the middle of the day for my daughters dance performances, or to catch up with a friend who's visiting town.

#### Have you ever burned out

Yes. I've burned out 3 times in my career. The first time, I just became a senior developer, just had my first child, and just bought my first house. The second time, I put my team in a position where they were setup for failure, and I didn't know how to declare success and move on. The third time, I didn't realize I was operating under extremely unrealistic expectations and didn't have support structure I needed.

#### Man this sounds awesome, but my boss has me completely overloaded

That's a hard position. My thoughts on task overload are [here](http://ig2600.blogspot.com/search?q=overload).

#### Did you always do this

No, when I was young and single, I wanted to build my tech muscles as fast as I could and often worked 50-60 hours a week. When I started Azure, I and the entire team worked 60 hours a week, and it was one of the most fun times in my career.

#### I'm young and single - I want to work like a dog - should I

Sure! That's what I did. If you want to do this, you're welcome in my team, but I'd recommend doing it in a team that is all working like a dog, you'll have more fun!
