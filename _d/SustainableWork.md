<!--
Who is the audience?
    - People I'm looking to recruit to my team.
    - People on my team who can hold me accountable to my aspirations
    - Igor
    - My future employers who want to build this culture
    - My current boss who is trying to figure out what is going on.
    - PART 2: My future employers that want to know why I'm doing this, and my strategies.

What are the 3 thing they should remember
    - Work life balance is crucial
    - Work life balance takes work.
    - Igor will prioritize and model good work life balance

How do I prove it?
    - Everyone says they do it - but how to prove?
    - Give examples of people doing it.
    - Show mechanisms of how.


Why does Igor need a reminder?
    - Work centered
    - If don't put in mechanisms, will just work like a dog.
    - If working in an unsustainable manner will burn out
    - Need to set and remember my boundaries

Sean's alternate intro:

Work life balance is a spectrum from working all of your waking hours to working the minimum you can get away with. You'll be happiest when you find a team who lands on the spectrum where you want to.  I love my job, but want to limit my work to 45 hours/week.  I don't want regrets like "X", "Y", "Z"

-->

<!-- Why? On your death bed -->

Imagine being on your deathbed, having one of your last conversations with your child.  Do you want to be saying "I wish I spent less time at work ", "I wish I spent more time with my family", "I wish I made time to take care of my health"?

I don't, and I bet you don't either.

The people I want to work with value a culture encouraging them to balance their family, health, hobbies and work - aka work life balance. For a culture to be real, the leadership team needs walk the talk, and I'll describe how I role model work life balance, and the mechanisms I use to help the team achieve balance.


### How do I model work life balance

Organizations reflect their leaders, and I strive to model work life balance.

**I leave at 4 pm, 4 days a week** My watch alarm goes off every day at 3:45pm, reminding me to wrap up for the day. It goes off a second time at 4:05, at which point I drop what I'm doing, grab my bag, and leave. I do this 4 days a week like clockwork. One day a week I'll stay late, usually with an open schedule. I do this because many people prefer to socialize around 4-6, and I want to be around for that - aka happy hour!

**I don't work evenings and weekends** I love my job when it's going well, and I have a huge sense of responsibility when it's going poorly. If I don't force myself to stop working, I won't. Thus, I have a simple rule which I stick to most of the time - don't work evening and weekends. There are exceptions when I want/need to work an evening or weekend, when that happens I'm religious about using delayed send to avoid my employees getting mails from me out of business hours.

**I don't have work e-mail on my phone** When I say I don't work on evenings and weekends I mean I don't work evenings and weekends and e-mail is work. If I had work e-mail on my phone I'd check it when I'm idle, so I can't have work e-mail from my phone. I do have chime (aka Skype/Slack/Teams)) in case something is urgent and folks want to get a hold of me.

**I proudly go to kids events during the day** My daughter is 4, the highlight of her life is her "ballet recital" it's the 3rd Wednesday every 4 months @ 11am. I won't miss it for the world.

**I book my vacations in advance, I take them, and I keep my work laptop off** Every year my mom comes for spring break, we visit my wife's family for a week around thanksgiving, we take a week in the summer to visit my sister in Canada, and we take some time to enjoy the kids being off school for winter break. As hard as it is to let go of work (and trust me it's way hard), I say sorry - this vacation is booked, I won't be available till I'm back from vacation.

### How do we make it easier to to achieve work life balance on my team

Work life balance requires organizational mechanisms and care, and here are some of ours. After describing our mechanisms, I'll describe Veronica's experience, which demonstares how we achieve work life balance.

**Unlimited paid time off** To encourage people to take care of themselves, we have [unlimited time off](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/269989). Some people take advantage of this naturally, but others require encouragement :) For example, this year July 4th was a Wednesday, so I removed two days of capacity from everyone's sprint and told them to be "sick" either Monday/Tuesday or Thursday/Friday. As another example, when folks do an internal transfer into my team I encourage them to take a few weeks off to refresh and reset.

**Realistic expectations for work deliverables** Anxiety is the difference between expectations and reality. To leave work at work, you need to feel good about the work you're doing.  Everyone gets work assignments that they won't be able to deliver. Regardless of if it happens because of a skill gap, the assignment being harder then expected, or unexpected life events, we'll quickly figure out what is realistic for you to deliver and what help you need to feel good. If the assignment needs to get done before you can do it,  we'll re-prioritize work others are doing to get you the help you need to succeed. In a nutshell, I know you're doing your best, and the team's got your back.

<!--
Go into the different reasons people get unrealistic expectations. Talk about what you do when it happens,
    - It's on 'only you' to deliver
    - You're letting the team down.
-->
*I'm getting closer on this section, but something still isn't fitting right - does this need a concrete example? A better description, ponder. Is this just important to me?*

**Flexible hours from wherever want to be** Everyone achieves work life balance differently, so the team does everything it can think of to make it easier to watch your daughter's soccer game, get your car to the mechanic, or go for an afternoon jog. For example, all our meetings are between 10 and 4, we use group messenger (Slack/Chime) heavily, we have meetings in rooms with video conferencing, and we have high quality microphones for ad-hoc conversations like stand up. I work remotely at least once a month, so if the experience sucks, I'm very incentivized to fix it.

**Humans are not resources/fungible/the sum of their deliverables** Everyone on my team is a 3-dimensional human with different wants, needs strengths and weaknesses.

*This section is really rough, brain dumping*

When you say "I need to" ... the answer is YES.
One on ones are not status reports - they are your time to spend as you wish. We build relationships as people (if you want).

Appreciation.

Praise.

Success doesn't need to be a promo - could be having a sick mom so wanting stability to take care of her.

No emails from me on evenings and weekends - To avoid people getting that jolt of stress when they get a mail from their boss when they're checking their e-mail on the weekend (which would be rare as I reserve evenings and weekends for my family) I queue up sending my mails for mornings on working days.

You should talk more about, you're there to get people where they want to be; the next level, an industry change, building skills to move somewhere else, etc. You enjoy helping people grow and become happier.

**Making work like having a blast with your friends** Having work be something you look forward to is so important to me, I'll have several posts on the topic. The first post, making memorable moments at work, is in [progress](moments-at-work).

### Veronica's Story

To illustrate these commitments I want to tell you about Veronica's recent experience.   Veronica, was a new mom on our team who realized she wanted to spend more time with her infant....
*flesh out these points*

- She Worked from home full time.
- Bought mics when stand up sounds quality sucked.
- Made sure everyone dialed her into meetings
- She Became overwhelmed, helped set expectations, change business and update work.
- She said she was deciding if she wanted to stay at work, or take a few years off.
- Connected her to other women I knew in tech who stayed at worked and left the work force to
- While she was decided, recommended she try reduced hours to see if that was a good deal for her.
- Encouraged her to take time off as she was having a rough time.

### The fine print

- Like all hard things, there are times where I slip up, and don't live up to my standards. If you see me doing this, call me out, and I'll do my best to course correct.
- There are times when we need to swing work life balance to work. They should be rare, clear ahead of time, and followed or proceeded by times where we can focus on our lives.
- Changing culture is a slow process so when I'm new to an organization expect a while for it to kick in.

In future posts, I'll describe how leaders can build a culture of work life balance into organizations that haven't embraced it yet.

### How do I manage up to enable work life balance (Sneak peek of post #2)

This topic is worthy of its own blog post, and it will get it. In the interim, here are a few examples of me going to bat for work life balance.

**The Friday at 4 meetings**
**The team event**
**The mandatory vacation**
**Blocking shipping**

When I joined a new organization, I was amazed that at noon Friday a director called a meeting for 4pm-5pm on the same Friday. The next Monday, I walked into the director's office and said "How much will I need to pay you to not have meetings after 4?" The director asked "Why?". I explained that I come in early, and like to leave by 4. The director then asked "Hymn, should we have no meetings after 3?". I replied 4 should be fine, and that was that. No meetings after 4.

-   Erica - Boat day at Sean's time off
-   Team breakfasts too long, too often
-   Don't want to go, I do it anyways
-   Less capacity on holiday weekends
-   Too much ambiguity for top down planning. Rebuild roadmap on fly
-   Shipping is a feature
-   9 Woman in 1 month do not a baby make
-   Real schedule, management schedule, happy to do both

### FAQ

**Really, you do this?** Like everyone else, my goals are aspirational and sometimes I miss. But I highly value feedback and expect my co-workers to hold me accountable when I'm not doing it.

**How many hours do you work a week?** My goal is to work 40-50 hours. I will not check e-mail on the evenings or weekends, but I do spend time on professional development like coding side projects and reading books on leadership. An important note - I don't ask my team how much they work, I ask them what did they accomplished.

**Have you ever burned out?** Yes. I've burned out 3 times in my career. The first time, I just became a senior developer, just had my first child, and just bought my first house. The second time, I put my team in a position where they were setup for failure, and I didn't know how to declare success and move on. The third time, I didn't realize I was operating under extremely unrealistic expectations and didn't have support structure I needed. I'll go into details on these situations in a future blog post(tbd).

**Your time off policy sounds great, but I want to write code non stop!** Building code muscles (or any skill) is great - I highly recommend it. I believe the best way to do that is to work on a side project or to take courses, and read a great programming book, you'll get to code, and learn about a whole different environment.

**I'm young and single - I want to work like a dog - should I?** You can, that's what I did at the start of my career. If you want to do this, choose your team carefully and make sure the folks working like a dog are actually getting more work done and not on a path to burn out.

**Sounds like I'm working less, how will this impact my career?** If someone works as effectively as you for 60 hours a week,  when you're working 40 hours a week, they'll get ahead. However, what I often see is the folks working 60 hours, are less effective with their time, and burn out after stretches of long hours.

**Did you always do this?** No, when I was young and single, I wanted to build my tech muscles as fast as I could and often worked 50-60 hours a week. When I started Azure, I and the entire team worked 60 hours a week, and it was one of the most fun times in my career.

**Man this sounds awesome, but my boss has me completely overloaded!** That's a hard position. My thoughts on task overload are in [draft](http://ig2600.blogspot.com/search?q=overload).
