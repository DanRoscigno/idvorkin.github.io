I want to die in Seattle, not soon,  but a great place to live.  Here's  some ideas if you're visisting

Igor's list:

1. Coolest Coffee: Star bucks roastery
1. Fremont: Troll/Lenin

By Neighborhood:

1. Fremont
1. Capitol Hill

By Classic Tourist Attration

1. Space Needle/Seattle Center
1. Pike Place Market


Stuff to skip:

1. First Starbucks - just a crappy coffee shop
