Win/Win is a constantly seeking mutual benefit in all interactions. Win/Win means that agreements or solutions are mutually beneficial, mutually satisfying. With a Win/Win solution, all parties feel good about the decision and feel committed to the action plan. Win/Win sees life as a cooperative, not a competitive arena. Most people tend to think in terms of dichotomies: strong or weak, hardball or softball, win or lose. But that kind of thinking is fundamentally flawed. It’s based on power and position rather than on principle. Win/Win is based on the paradigm that there is plenty for everybody, that one person’s success is not achieved at the expense or exclusion of the success of others.

These are my insights based on the [7 habits](/7h) Chapter 4.

### Everything else is Lose/Lose

### Ingredients for Win/Win

#### Character

- INTEGRITY. Habits 1, 2 and 3. Being Proactive, beginning with the end in mind, and putting first things first.
- MATURITY. Maturity is _the balance between courage and consideration._ Emotional maturity “the ability to express one’s own feelings and convictions balanced with consideration for the thoughts and feelings of others

#### Abundance mentality

The Abundance Mentality, the paradigm that there is plenty out there for everybody. A rising tide, lifts all boats.
