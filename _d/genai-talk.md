Generative AI (GenAI) is taking the world by storm, and it takes a new mindset to make use of it as a programmer. A good mental model of GenAI is interns!

## A New Computational Model - Interns

ASIDE: No interns were harmed in the creation of this talk. I love interns, and have been one myself. I'm just using them as a metaphor for LLMs. If you're an intern, or recently graduated, feel free to read my advice to y'all - <http://bit.ly/igor-advice-22>

### The Perfect Intern

- Super smart
- Super creative
- Understand English and high complexity
  - Don't need to 'dumb it down', just talk in natural language
- Infinite creativity
  - Don't need to 'search' for an image, just have them genereate it!

### Bad Intern - Quirks and Mitigations

- But makes mistakes
- So you need to coach and guide
- Non-deterministic: Every call you get a different intern.
- Sometimes it'll just be a bad intern, can lie, or ignore instructions.
- Slow: Current models have bad latency and rate limits (bleh)
- TODO: Link to build '23 talk by OpenAI scientist.
- Sometimes you get a dud and they ignore the instructions. :(
- The longer the answer, the more they can think; short answers have them thinking less.
- Once committed to an answer, even if wrong, they'll keep going.
- Very dangerous, since so used to smart, honest interns, when you get a bad intern that's confident, it can really throw you for a loop.

### Your Intern Can't Read Your Mind - Prompting

- Input is conversational.
- When instructing our intern, we assume we have sufficiently specified what we want.
- But very quickly realize you haven't.
- Very hard to evaluate if your intern did good
- See prompt engineering.

### Annual Review - Evaluating your intern

### Why the heck did your intern do that - Understandability

### Brain Surgery - Do I need to understand paramater count and neural networks

- No more then you need to understand dopamine or synapses.

## Use cases: What should we hire the intern to do?

### The Perfect Sandals - Remember the user problem

- What makes perfect sandals?
- Research, you build, but no one buys?
- What is going on? You go out and do user studies. Turns out the users are trying to mountain climb, no sandal will work for them.
- Start by understanding the problem you are trying to solve, see how you can use AI to help solve that probvlem.
- Otherwise the anti-pattern, a solution looking for a problem

### Relationships

- AI Partner - Replika
- Therapist - 7 Cups of Tea
- Celebrity - Caryn.ai

### Summarize

### Express myself

- Grammerly

### Programmer

- Copilot
- Code Review
- Security Scanning

## Programs with hidden interns - Blending Code and Mind Reading

Conventional Programming vs Delegating to an Intern

### LLM as Computer

- LLM is the CPU
- You need to write the program for the LLM, thatâ€™s the prompt
- Big problem is the context window, or RAM.
- Your job is the efficiently use the RAM, you can store anything you want in the hard drive. You need to figure out how to go from hard drive data to RAM

### The Before Times - It's All Code (Code)

### The Perfect Program - It Just Reads Your Mind (Prompts)

- At design time you make a few static prompts, and use that to design a template
- At compile time you include a template in your program
- At runtime you create a prompt by instantiating a template with the user (or program) input

### Maybe Reading Your Mind Is Too Hard - Input Affordances

#### Natural Language Input

#### Constrained Language Input

#### Graphical Selection

### Give Me Choices - Output Affordances

#### Select between multiple outputs

#### Use output to help refine my input

#### Use output to help refine my tuning of input

### Balancing Code and Prompts

## Bad Intern - All the things that can go wrong

### Alignment - Don't be evil

- Getting around the blocks. Answer in spanish, then translate the block to english
- See password guessing

### Societal Bias

- Draw a picture of a doctor - 90% male
- Societal biases are in the data, and the model will learn them.
- Yesterdays heritic migth be today's genius

### Git supply chain attacks

### AGI taking over the world

## Appendix

### LLM-Book

Very deeply inspired by: <https://vladris.com/llm-book/>

### Talk to the intern

- Ha, make a chat bot from this post ... pending
