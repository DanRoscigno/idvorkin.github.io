I've learned what I like, how I want to spend my energy,and how I want to be thinking about my life. I've learned my roles, reasonable expectations, and healthy ways to operate given my personality, behaviors, and frequently occurring situations. This post is a summary of those learnings - an operating manual if you will, reminding me how to think about, respond to and behave, so I can operate at maximum effectiveness and efficiency.

## Career

### [Joining Facebook](/facebook)

In mid 2020, I joined [Facebook](/facebook) and it has been an absolute pleasure. Facebook is very aligned with my desired culture: Top shelf people, top notch management, a genuine caring about people, and a move fast and iterate culture.

### [Joining Amazon](/amazon)

At the end of 2016, I joined [Amazon](/amazon) to learn the business of software, to learn to [write](/writing) and to live by the leadership principles. It was my first job outside of Microsoft where I'd worked for 15 years and it was a tough transition.

### [Dream Job](/dream-job)

In my [dream job](/dream-job) I learn the customer and business needs and focus the team on delivering them in a sustainable manner. Simultaneously, I help team members grow, develop our culture, and build valuable tech. When talking to others I prefer a couch to a table, and when I need a break you might see me juggling, practicing magic, or riding my folding bike - often in the office.

### [Being a Great Manager](/manager-book)

I spent a lot of time learning to be a manager, and am [writing a book, or really notes to myself](/manager-book).

### My super powers

#### Relationships

- Investing time in relationships always pays out. It can feel expensive, but it's always worth it.

#### Technical Depth and Breadth

#### Technical Best Practice

#### Ability to sanity test all tech stuff.

#### From [Strength Finder](/strength-finder)

Developing you strengths is 3 times as effective as improving your weakness, so find your strengths and double down. To bootstrap the discovery of my strengths, I used a tool called Strength Finder and it discovered my strengths are Activator , Communication, Problem Solving (Resolver in Strength Finder speak) Adaptability, and Ideation.

### My kryptonite

#### Bean counting

#### Committing and describing relative to ideal, not relative to reality.

#### Under estimating technical complexity

## Health and habits

Health - physical, emotional, cognitive and spiritual, is easy to understand but hard to maintain. My strategy to maintain health is [habits](/habits), but thanks to the [immutable laws of hard things](http://~/Immutable-Laws-Of-Hard), habits degrade without constant vigilance.

I spend lots of time thinking about how I should be working my habits, but often end up not doing them. In this case, the key is to stop moaning and restart 'em.

### [Physical](/physical-health)

### [Emotional](/emotional-health)

### [Cognitive](/writing)

### [Identity](/eulogy)

### [Hobbies](/hobby)

I've already got enough hobbies - biking, magic, juggling. I get my biking fix no problem.

### [Biking](/bike)

### [Magic](/magic)

### [Juggling](http://ig66.blogspot.com/2014/08/accomplishment-unlocked-juggling-file.html?q=torches)

## Morning Routine

At my best, I roll out of bed either when my eyes open or at 5am, what ever comes first.

I also love getting my morning hug from my kids, but now that Zach's older (9), I'm down to just getting the hugs from Amelia - who is 5.

### Weekend morning routine

On the weekends, the gym opens at 8, so it's essential I drink my coffee in my home office chair so I work on whatever is most important to me, often reading or writing. At 7:30 it's time to drag my but to the gym.

Post gym I'll either hit the coffee shop to do some more writing, or head home to spend the day with my family.

### Weekday morning routine

At my best, I roll out of bed either when my eyes open or at 5am, what ever comes first.

The gym opens at 5:30, and I try to be there by 6. After my work out, I often chillax with my next priority being walking the kids to school. Walking the kids to school has surprisingly been a major quality of life improvement for a very small impact to my day.

### Morning Kryptonite

I have two common failure modes to my morning routine.

- Starting my day by sitting in my easy chair drinking my coffee. This mindless activity has me skipping those things that are important to me.
- Hitting snooze when my alarm goes off. The worst of all words, not sleeping, and not being up and doing stuff.
- Lying in bed awake when I wake up before 5. Sometimes I wake up and can't fall back asleep @ 3 or 4 (which isn't crazy cuz sometimes I go to bed @ 7 or 8). Similar to hitting snooze, I'm not sleeping, and I'm not accomplishing anything.

## Family

### Husband

### Father

## Cognitive Reframe Upgrades

The words you use influence how you think.

- I'm under water --> I'm fully booked this week
- I'm not doing a good job --> When I'm at my best I do
- I manage the XYZ team -> I support the XYZ team
- This is crap --> Help me understand (/compassion)

## Triggers and Mental Quick Sand

Like most folks I have triggers and mental quick sand which I can get trapped in. Here's some of mine, and things I need to remember. This also reminds me of the [voices in my head](/voices)

### Stress and [anxiety](/anxiety)

### Corona Virus

- My gosh this is sucking up lots of brain power. I don't think I get value thinking about this. I have two choices, stop thinking about this,_OR_ write a post on all my thoughts on this.

### Raising kids

#### [Physical health](/physical-health)

#### Not spending enough time with them

When it comes to family, like all things, it's easy to confuse hours for quality. Being at home playing on his tablet, while the kids played on theirs wasn't family time. Instead Igor realized the key is having dates, a time he gave the gift of his complete attention to Amelia, Zach and Tori. Date nights were sacred and could be whatever the kid wanted. Here's a [nice date night](/ig66/587)

#### [Diet and Weight](/diet)

### [Financial Security](/money)

#### The point of [money](/money)

Money isn't just to make piles, it's to enable you to do stuff. Stuff does not equal stuff you don't use, stuff is actually often experiences. And most of the best stuff you can't buy. Yup, it's doing and it's with whom you are doing it.

#### What would I do for less money

If you wouldn't take a job for a pay cut, you probably shouldn't take the job.

#### Making more vs spending more

See [Parkinson's law](/parkinson), applies to both time and Money.
