Time off is critical, it's how we renew our energy, find our creativity, etc. Many people think of time off as synonymous with vacation, but I think there are 2 kinds of time off. Vacation, and personal development.

## The phases of time off

A common questions is should you take 2 short vacations or 1 long one. That's a tough choice. I'm not sure I have an opinion on that, but I've learned my time off goes through a few phases, and I suspect there's a fixed time component, and if I can better understand the phases, I can better spend my time off.

1. Vegetation - Getting over being tired.
1. TODO list - Cross those small things you've been putting off your TODO list
1. Freedom - Savoring your ability to do nothing
1. Productivity - Realizing there are important not urgent things you can do at your own pace.

### Vegetation

Work is stressful, it follows me home, and it takes several days to "drain". I think there's a relation between "draining my work stress" and vegetation. It takes me a solid week to get over that.

### TODO list

Time is scarce, things to be done are infinite, and they pile up when you have limited time. Once my work stress drains, I have a burst of Energy, and I apply that to my todo list. This is very satisfying as I feel energized and productive.

### Personal Development (PD)

When you're recharged, feel satisfied that enough is off your todo list, and are ready to build a better you. Personal development can be a personal thing, like becoming a better writer, or training for a marathon, or professional, like building a skill required in your career.

## Very Vegetating

Vegetation comes in few flavors. 1) Ignoring your responsibilities and task list 2) Ignoring your habits and discipline 3) Being selfish and ignoring your friends and family.

I think it's fair to ignore your responsibility and task list - you deserve it.

You likely think your habits and discipline are a burden, and that you deserve to ignore them. Except, that's the [resistance](/resistance) lying to you! Your habits, while time negative (barely) are net energy positive, and if you skip them, you'll not only have less energy, but you'll feel worse, a double whammy.

Ignoring Friends and Family - This flavor is the least clear cut. Your family and friends want to enjoy themselves, but you also need alone time, I think the best balance is finding a fair balance, and then setting expectations and honoring them. See the "Managing family expectations section.

So, on behalf of future you, when you want to vegetate, let go of your responsibilities, but don't skip your positive habits!

In recap:

| How you want to vegetate        | Future you's request                                    |
|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Tasks and responsibilities      | Ignore 'em you deserve it                               |
| Habits, exercise and discipline | Do them, you'll have more energy to enjoy your vacation |
| Being selfish                   | Seek balance, Set expectations, and honor them          |



## Powerful Personal Development

### Managing family expectations

PD is essentially working from home, but working for your future self. Just like when you work from home you need to set family expectations, you need to do the same for your family. This can include, dedicated space, getting out of the house, providing a calendar.

### PD vs Life Balance

Even though getting to do what you love is awesome, you still want to love your family. You've got an opportunity to spend more energy on them, so do.

### Optimizing for happiness

- Being [Happy](/happy)
