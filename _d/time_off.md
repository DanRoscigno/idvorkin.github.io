Time off is critical, it's how we renew our energy, find our creativity, etc. Many people think of time off as synonymous with vacation, which is the case when you turn your 1 week off into an action packed tour of disneyland. But, there are other kinds of time off that we'll discuss too.

## The phases of time off

A common questions is should you take 2 short vacations or 1 long one. That's a tough choice. I'm not sure I have an opinion on that, but I've learned my time off goes through a few phases, and I suspect there's a fixed time component, and if I can better understand the phases, I can better spend my time off.

1. Vegetation - Getting over being tired.
1. TODO list - Cross those small things you've been putting off your TODO list
1. Freedom - Savoring your ability to do nothing
1. Productivity - Realizing there are important not urgent things you can do at your own pace.

### Vegetation

Work is stressful, it follows me home, and it takes several days to "[drain](/mind-at-work)". I think there's a relation between "draining my work stress" and vegetation. It takes me a solid week to get over that.

### TODO list

Time is scarce, things to be done are infinite, and they pile up when you have limited time. Once my work stress drains, I have a burst of Energy, and I apply that to my todo list. This is very satisfying as I feel energized and productive.

### Personal Development (PD)

When you're recharged, feel satisfied that enough is off your todo list, and are ready to build a better you. Personal development can be a personal thing, like becoming a better writer, or training for a marathon, or professional, like building a skill required in your career.

## Very Vegetating

Vegetation comes in few flavors. 1) Ignoring your responsibilities and task list 2) Ignoring your habits and discipline 3) Being selfish and ignoring your friends and family.

I think it's fair to ignore your responsibility and task list - you deserve it.

You likely think your habits and discipline are a burden, and that you deserve to ignore them. Except, that's the [resistance](/resistance) lying to you! Your habits, while time negative (barely) are net energy positive, and if you skip them, you'll not only have less energy, but you'll feel worse, a double whammy.

Ignoring Friends and Family - This flavor is the least clear cut. Your family and friends want to enjoy themselves, but you also need alone time, I think the best balance is finding a fair balance, and then setting expectations and honoring them. See the "Managing family expectations section.

So, on behalf of future you, when you want to vegetate, let go of your responsibilities, but don't skip your positive habits!

In recap:

| You want to skip                | Future you recommends                                   |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Tasks and responsibilities      | Ignore 'em you deserve it                               |
| Habits, exercise and discipline | Do them, you'll have more energy to enjoy your vacation |
| Your friends and family         | Seek balance, Set expectations, and honor them          |

## Powerful Personal Development

### Managing family expectations

PD is essentially working from home, but working for your future self. Just like when you work from home you need to set family expectations, you need to do the same for your family. This can include, dedicated space, getting out of the house, providing a calendar.

### PD vs Life Balance

Even though getting to do what you love is awesome, you still want to love your family. You've got an opportunity to spend more energy on them, so do.

### Optimizing for happiness

- Being [Happy](/happy)

## Get real what should I do?

### Time box vegetation

Acknowledge you deserve to vegetate, and give your self a day or 2 guilt free. At the end of the prescribed limit, start to fight the resistance.

### Strategize against the resistance.

You can fight the [resistance](/resistance) by making your [addictions](/addictions) harder. For me that means uinstall TikTok.

Add by making your positive habits easier. For me, this includes remembering what my good habits are, and how much better I feel when I do them. And then running a habit app to make sure I'm doing them.

### Begin with the end in mind

- Read your [eulogy](/eulogy), to remember what matters most to you.
- Remember not to [procrastinate](/frog).

## Examples of how I spent my time off

Look at the incoming links below and:

## Making the most out of staycation.

With staycations, it's especially easy to oscillate between vegetating, grinding through the todo list, and ruminating on work. I suspect there are special tools for staycations - I should think through them.

## Other Resources

### Optimize for energy, not time

### Can you have too much time off?

Need to explore further, from [this study](https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/psp-pspp0000391.pdf):

_Many people living in modern society feel like they do not have enough time and are constantly searching
for more. But is having limited discretionary time actually detrimental? And can there be downsides of having too much discretionary time? We find a negative quadratic relationship between discretionary time and subjective well-being. These results show that having too little time is indeed linked to lower subjective well-being caused by stress, having more time does not continually translate to greater subjective well-being._

_Having an abundance of discretionary time is sometimes even linked to lower subjective well-being because of a lacking sense of productivity. In such cases, the negative effect of having too much
discretionary time can be attenuated when people spend this time on productive activities._
