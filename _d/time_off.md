Time off is critical, it's how we renew our energy, find our creativity, etc. Many people think of time off as synonymous with vacation, but I think there are 2 kinds of time off. Vacation, and professional development.

## The phases of time off

A common questions is should you take 2 short vacations or 1 long one. That's a tough choice. I'm not sure I have an opinion on that, but I've learned my time off goes through a few phases, and I suspect there's a fixed time component, and if I can better understand the phases, I can better spend my time off.

1. Vegetation - Getting over being tired.
1. TODO list - Cross those small things you've been putting off your TODO list
1. Freedom - Savoring your ability to do nothing
1. Productivity - Realizing there are important not urgent things you can do at your own pace.

### Vegetation

Work is stressful, it follows me home, and it takes several days to "drain". I think there's a relation between "draining my work stress" and vegetation. It takes me a solid week to get over that.

### TODO list

Time is scarce, things to be done are infinite, and they pile up when you have limited time. Once my work stress drains, I have a burst of Energy, and I apply that to my todo list. This is very satisfying as I feel energized and productive.

### Professional Development (PD)

## Zooming in on PD

### Managing family expectations

PD is essentially working from home, but working for your future self. Just like when you work from home you need to set family expectations, you need to do the same for your family. This can include, dedicated space, getting out of the house, providing a calendar.

### PD vs Life Balance

Even though getting to do what you love is awesome, you still want to love your family. You've got an opportunity to spend more energy on them, so do.
