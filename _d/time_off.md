Time off is super important, it's how we recharge, find our creativite, etc. Many people think of timeoff as synonymous with vacation, but I think there are 2 kinds of time off. Vacation, and professional developement.

## The phases of time off

A common questions is should you take 2 short vacations or 1 long one. That's a tough choice. I'm not sure I have an opinion on that, but I've learned my time off goes through a few phases, and I suspect there's a fixed time compoent.

1. Vegetation - Getting over being tired.
1. Todo list - Cross those small things you've been putting off your todo list
1. Freedom - Savoring your ability to do nothing
1. Productivity - Realizing there are important not urgent things you can do at your own pace.

Work is stressful, it follows me home, and it takes several days to "drain". I think it takes me a solid week to stop thining about work,

### Vacation

### Professional Development

#### Managing family expectations

PD is essentially working from home, but working for your future self. Just like when you work from home you need to set familiy expectations, you need to do the same for your family. This can include, dedicated space, getting out of the house, providing a calaneder.

#### Professional Development Life Balance

Even though getting to do what you love is awesome, you still want to love your family. You've got an opportunity to spend more energy on them, so do.

## Optimizing for happiness

### Types of happiness: Pleasure, Flow and Identity

### The experiencing and remembering self - the peak end rule.

We remember according to the peak end rule, the average of the peak event and the last event. This is why you should end your vacations with something awesome (as opposed to fighting with your family). The funniest version of the peak end rule comes from the world of colonoscopies. Normally the colonoscopy ends with the 'peak pain', if you artificially extend your colonoscopy with some less painful experiences, you'll remember your colonscopy as less painful, even though it was longer, and started with the exact same pain.

### Moments

Most of life is auto-pilot (think about how movies are 2 hours, and cover years), what you remember, are momenets. Optimize for them.
