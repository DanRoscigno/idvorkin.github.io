Time off is critical, it's how we renew our energy, find our creativity, etc. Many people think of time off as synonymous with vacation, which is the case when you turn your 1 week off into an action packed tour of disneyland. But, there are other kinds of time off that we'll discuss too.

## The phases of time off

A common questions is should you take 2 short vacations or 1 long one. That's a tough choice. I'm not sure I have an opinion on that, but I've learned my time off goes through a few phases, and I suspect there's a fixed time component, and if I can better understand the phases, I can better spend my time off.

1. Vegetation - Getting over being tired.
1. TODO list - Cross those small things you've been putting off your TODO list
1. Freedom - Savoring your ability to do nothing
1. Productivity - Realizing there are important not urgent things you can do at your own pace.

### Vegetation

Work is stressful, it follows me home, and it takes several days to "[drain](/mind-at-work)". I think there's a relation between "draining my work stress" and vegetation. It takes me a solid week to get over that.

### TODO list

Time is scarce, things to be done are infinite, and they pile up when you have limited time. Once my work stress drains, I have a burst of Energy, and I apply that to my todo list. This is very satisfying as I feel energized and productive.

### Personal Development (PD)

When you're recharged, feel satisfied that enough is off your todo list, and are ready to build a better you. Personal development can be a personal thing, like becoming a better writer, or training for a marathon, or professional, like building a skill required in your career.

## Very Vegetating

Vegetation comes in few flavors. 1) Ignoring your responsibilities and task list 2) Ignoring your habits and discipline 3) Being selfish and ignoring your friends and family.

I think it's fair to ignore your responsibility and task list - you deserve it.

You likely think your habits and discipline are a burden, and that you deserve to ignore them. Except, that's the [resistance](/resistance) lying to you! Your habits, while time negative (barely) are net energy positive, and if you skip them, you'll not only have less energy, but you'll feel worse, a double whammy.

Ignoring Friends and Family - This flavor is the least clear cut. Your family and friends want to enjoy themselves, but you also need alone time, I think the best balance is finding a fair balance, and then setting expectations and honoring them. See the "Managing family expectations section.

So, on behalf of future you, when you want to vegetate, let go of your responsibilities, but don't skip your positive habits!

In recap:

| You want to skip                | Future you recommends                                   |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Tasks and responsibilities      | Ignore 'em you deserve it                               |
| Habits, exercise and discipline | Do them, you'll have more energy to enjoy your vacation |
| Your friends and family         | Seek balance, Set expectations, and honor them          |

## Powerful Personal Development

### Managing family expectations

PD is essentially working from home, but working for your future self. Just like when you work from home you need to set family expectations, you need to do the same for your family. This can include, dedicated space, getting out of the house, providing a calendar.

### PD vs Life Balance

Even though getting to do what you love is awesome, you still want to love your family. You've got an opportunity to spend more energy on them, so do.

### Optimizing for happiness

- Being [Happy](/happy)

## Get real what should I do?

### Time box vegetation

Acknowledge you deserve to vegetate, and give your self a day or 2 guilt free. At the end of the prescribed limit, start to fight the resistance.

### Strategize against the resistance

You can fight the [resistance](/resistance) by making your [addictions](/addictions) harder. For me that means uinstall TikTok.

Add by making your positive habits easier. For me, this includes remembering what my good habits are, and how much better I feel when I do them. And then running a habit app to make sure I'm doing them.

### Begin with the end in mind

- Read your [eulogy](/eulogy), to remember what matters most to you.
- Remember not to [procrastinate](/frog).

## Examples of how I spent my time off

Look at the incoming links below and:

- [April 2020 - Time between leaving Amazon and Joining Facebook](/td/time-off-3-2020)

## Making the most out of staycation

With staycations, it's especially easy to oscillate between vegetating, grinding through the todo list, and ruminating on work. I suspect there are special tools for staycations - I should think through them.

## Combined Learnings

Here are the combined learnigns from my time offs. Make sure to read an interalize it!

### Before you go

- Pre-writing your desires/goals for time off (see this template).
  - If you begin with the end in mind you can get it done
  - Then you need to check in and review tune over time
  - Don't over do your todo list, after all you should get a break too.
- Wrap up everything before you go.
  - Got done everything I needed at work the week before so had no work baggage.
  - Load up your todo list for when you're back and trust you'll come back and get back
- Visualize the battle of the resistance, prepare mentally to avoid it.
  - If I don't force my self to maintain my habits, and stay balanced - I won't (I did zero magic).
  - Decide when you'll check in with your plans.
- Create a won't do list
  - I can get sucked into programming, but I want to avoid it.
- Write up your phychic Weight
  - Just naming it helps you get it under control.

### Every other day checkin

  - My habits are energizing, the time spent is actually time positive from additional magic.
  - If I don't force my self to maintain my habits, and stay balanced - I won't
  - Don't skip habits, they give you the energy
- **Use your own evaluation criteria, avoid sunk costs** - What "should be best", probably isn't do what's most important to you and your identity, not "what should" happen.
  - At magic conference, 10 hours of magic a day, burning out on it.
    - Decide to skip types of magic I like less for my hobbies and travel.
  - Ask yourself if you're actually doing what you enjoy. Beware sunk cost fallacy.
- **Hobbies are OK if part of charging up:**
  - Before family wakes up
  - Tell family the plans so they aren't surprised and expectations are set.
  - Tech/content time before the kids wake up is totally fine.
- **Handle the todo's and physic weight early**
  - Get the todo items done, or scheduled so they aren't dragging you down.
  - See what else is stressing you and finish it.
  - Check in on pychic weight and decide if you should be doing it or not.
- **Am I getting enough relationship time vs self time** - Your family and relationships are precious be sure to nuruture them ,but also need time for self (and so do others

- **Slack** - Have lots of slack (See [Essential](/essential)).
  - Made time with my family much more enjoyable when I wasn't in a rush and sucecess was being with them.
  - Same with going to the airport, got there hours early. Didn't matter that got stuck at the car rental return. Didn't matter that my flight got delayed, can write, meditate do some inner work.
- **Continuous learning** - Always a learning opportunity, learn what needs to be learned and move on.
- **Don't berate mistakes** - Getting off the plane, it was super bright in torontoo. I opened my sunglasses case, and turns out I brought a second pair of glasses. OMG, I'll be blind, this will be terrible. Meh, was on the beach 20 hours over the weekend, was fine, turns out I hav ean abilityt o squint. Nothing terrible happens.
- **Don't catasrophize** - On the flight down realized I didn't bring the credit card on which I booked the car, and need to use for insurance. Thought would need it to checkout car. Freaked out a bit, got there - turns out it was totally fine. Also though I'd lost my popcorn popper, and balloon pump, and laptop - I didn't. Also thought my forcedd check bags would be lost forever. They weren't.
- **Stop panicking and think** - Turns out my friend was flying into Toronto, so got him to bbring my sunglasses.

### Optimize for energy, not time

### Can you have too much time off?

Need to explore further, from [this study](https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/psp-pspp0000391.pdf):

_Many people living in modern society feel like they do not have enough time and are constantly searching
for more. But is having limited discretionary time actually detrimental? And can there be downsides of having too much discretionary time? We find a negative quadratic relationship between discretionary time and subjective well-being. These results show that having too little time is indeed linked to lower subjective well-being caused by stress, having more time does not continually translate to greater subjective well-being._

_Having an abundance of discretionary time is sometimes even linked to lower subjective well-being because of a lacking sense of productivity. In such cases, the negative effect of having too much
discretionary time can be attenuated when people spend this time on productive activities._
