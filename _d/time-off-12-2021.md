title: Time off X-mas 2021
---

It's Corona virus X-mas, not so bad edition, and I've got 2 weeks off. In an attempt to maximize my personal development and satisfaction during my timeoff, by staying balanced, and minimizing my vegetation I'm going to pre-write what I want to get done, and adjust it as I go.

This is a combination of [time off](/time-off), and all the stuff for [happiness](/happy), which I guess gets tangled up with half of my evergreen notes.

I took the first 2 days to vegitate, which wasn't a conscious decision, it was just what happened when I didn't think about it. And boy did I vegitate. I think all I did on Sunday was consume media on my iPad and TV.

## Moments

## Success Stories

I've used this time to restart the flywheel on magic, and diet, re-inforce my discipline, and keep a balance with my family.

## Mental quicksand

### Spending vacation days when it's "fun time at work"

It's a trade off taking time off during the holidays.

The pro of working during x-mas break:

- Most folks have taken off so there are no meetings, and you can spend the time on fun projects

The pro of time off during x-max break:

- The kids are also off, so an optimal time to spend with them
- There are naturally 4 holiday days so spending 6 days, you get a solid 14 days off.

### January is going to be a tough month at work.

January will be my first calibration at FB, I've got multiple people onboarding, and planning and all the normal manager complexities simultaniously. All of these situations occur naturally while being a manager, but it is hard when they all happen at the same time. I'll spend some time during holidays writing out reasonable expectations and best practices for dealing with these.
