title: Time off X-mas 2021
---

It's Corona virus X-mas, not so bad edition, and I've got 2 weeks off. In an attempt to maximize my personal development and satisfaction during my timeoff, by staying balanced, and minimizing my vegetation I'm going to pre-write what I want to get done, and adjust it as I go.

This is a combination of [time off](/time-off), and all the stuff for [happiness](/happy), which I guess gets tangled up with half of my evergreen notes.

## Moments

## Success Stories

I've used this time to restart the flywheel on magic, and diet, re-inforce my discipline, and keep a balance with my family.

## Top Learnings

- This year, reads almost [identical to last year](/td/time-off-12-2020). Not sure if that means I've solved it, or I'm stuck in a local maximum? I guess regardless I'm not regressing.

### Software for Balance

Interesting to think about how my blog can help me achieve balance. Prompts for things i enjoy seems like a good idea.

- Some notion of weekly reviews with scoring.
- Make up some UX for graphing my balance
- Review and have someone else score your balance.
- Update prompting system to be stateful, so it prompts you more for stuff you haven't been doing, or need more investment in.

## Mental quicksand

### Spending vacation days when it's "fun time at work"

It's a trade off taking time off during the holidays.

The pro of working during x-mas break:

- Most folks have taken off so there are no meetings, and you can spend the time on fun projects

The pro of time off during x-max break:

- The kids are also off, so an optimal time to spend with them
- There are naturally 4 holiday days so spending 6 days, you get a solid 14 days off.

### January is going to be a tough month at work.

January is calibration time at Meta. That's high work load and stress as a manager, but this will be my 3rd calibration at Meta, and like the 10th?? of my career. I have lots of calibration best practices to follow, and I'll tackle that when January rolls around.
