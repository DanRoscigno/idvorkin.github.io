This is the draft post being migrated to [here](/the-manager-book). Managing is hard. Lessons are hard earned, and should be cherished. This series of posts is designed to draw out my opinions on management. It reminds me how to behave, and encourages others to poke into my reasoning and help me improve. I'm using an interview format for this post, as that's an easy way to start.

## Part #1: What does a manager do

### Horizontal vs Vertical: What specific types of duties would you like to do help with at this company?

Beyond "My team", there are several non-tech initiatives I like to drive, 1) recruiting 2) interns 3) inclusion and diversity.
On the tech side: Iterative, Metrics Driven, Hard off the wheel automation.

Recruiting

- Hiring Event
- Weekly posts

Moments

- Team Breakfasts
- Celebrations

Interns

- Team allocation
- Events
- Ship Gifts
- Help w/weak manager w/perf management.
- Checkin
- Major Talk

Culture

- Inclusion
- Always improving.

## Part 2: Managing and Developing People

## Part 4: Self Assessment and Weakness

### Disagreement answer format

- Push back good because of blind spots
- They thought
- I thought
- So I
- And this happened
- Leanings
- Afterwords I circled back and they thought

### What was the biggest 'mental model' shift you had from IC to manager?

- Auditing
- Value of process and checklists
- Team being the peer leads.

### Top Weakness

### Get in a fight with your boss

#### Music Video

#### Moderation Reactive vs Proactive

#### Co boss

#### Shutdown alternate platforms

#### Break big bang creator studio down into

### Get in a fight technical

#### Service split and shared component

#### Need SDE-III to do work that was below him.

#### Architect won't let us launch without committing to next release.

    * Architect need to save face.
    * Still doing the change, but add a "design" for next release, and we both knew it was dumb.

#### Variable Heart Beat

### Get in a fight PM

#### Creator Portal initial launch - We're acceptable to ship with several gaps.

#### Who needs file compression for video upload.

#### Brands

- Need to have experiment and hypothesis.
- stop doing tech sales pitch,
- never commit my team without my explicit sign off
- don't bully my people

### Get in a fight with other

#### Smile w/Legal.

### Think of a mistake or failure you’ve made in the past two years. What did you learn from it and/or do differently in the future?

#### Push GSAT when parent team though it was a bad idea.

#### Launching Creator Portal

- Major Feature (still hadn’t established full trust)

- Launching of WAMD by keyword - precision and recall hard.
  - Testing w/Non peak traffic, precision high, recall low. Happy with that.
  - Late brought up could have very different traffic pattern for peak (couldn’t pre-test)
  - Came up with Plan
    - Hourly monitoring for gaps
    - 3 types of shutdown switches (all off, blacklist bad, whitelist good)
    - 99% latency.
- Next time
  - Will run same protocol again this year.
  - Come up with an offline computation model for next prime day.

**Leanings - How I handled the “Though shalt not pass” conversation from my VP**

- Launching Charity Giving
  - VP decided we’ll need to do video sharing to FB/Twitter
  - Boss didn’t push back, just pass through.
  - Yup, my mistake. How can we get this working.
  - Decent idea, but My team was 100% booked, and no experience.
  - Begged other leads for an expert in this area. Spent 2 days to see if it was possible, found out it wasn’t possible for 2 days, then got sign off from a VP, made a nice package for my boss, who brought it up the tree.

#### Over committing my team

- Q4 2018 - Wanted to do charity
  - Committed team to deliver - “Lets take 2 weeks and make sure we can do this” , team agreed. Then we pushed hard, and hot but we’d make it and start converging.
  - As got closer, standard cut stuff.
  - New, requests from other parts of the organization - must do I18N, can’t get it off our plate
  - Must do a new time of coupon (which was already cut)
  - Load testing want completely wrong.
  - **Everything** went wrong
- Team killed themselves till thanksgiving
  - Which they didn’t mind because of the purpose off the launch.
  - HOWEVER: Said we’d get a break post Thanksgiving. And we didn’t, get more stuff put on us I18N and another coupon type.
  - Couldn’t get it negotiated off my team (Amazon — Grr!!)

**Learning for next time**

- Target done 1.5 months early (will slip to 1 months, and then need the E2E time, or bring new features in)
- Agreement on what features we’d cut if required when we got closer.
- Left in more slack so didn’t get pushed over
- Shared data up with what happened last time w/data and wouldn’t over commit.
- Stopped other teams from over committing.
- Done with 2 weeks to spare.

### What would a report/peer/manager feedback on you be? Strengths, areas for development, etc.

- Report
  - Care, Great Advice, People First, Strong People chops
  - Gaps:
    - Organization - my desk is a mess, and I miss stuff (Mitigate: Push my whole team to audit, constant list of top risks)
- Boss

  - Same as reports
  - Hiring - Wow
  - Impressive handling of complex situations.
  - Commit Faster when you aren’t in agreement
    - Customer -> Team > Business vs Customer > Team > Business
  - Start by assuming I’m right, instead of me being wrong
    - Exact opposite o what I tell me, I need them to assume I”m wrong due to positional authority
  - Don’t be so harsh on “slow” partners.
    - I stay don’t get blocked and want to ship, people who are in agreement love me. People that don’t I’ll Figure out how to get around.
  - (Less experienced) Be less autonomous.

    - Lots of ideas, change fast, check with me more often.

  - Peer
    - Want to ship
    - How do you pull that off
  - Good
    - Team loves you
    - Creative
  - Gaps
    - Going too Fast.
    - Keep me in the loop
    - Be more risk averse

### How would you assess if someone is a good manager?

Using the same metrics I apply to myself. For the how I'd:

- Look at "employee surveys"
- Look at their business results (scorecards and KPI)
- Look at their operational load and tickets/pages/etc
- Interview their employees, PMs, and business partners, and partner teams
- Ask them about their architecture
- Ask them the interview questions

## Part 5: Process and Mechanism

#### Team gelling

- Team meetings,
  - Focus on reflection.
  - Focus on what ever is the "mood" of the team.
  - Reflect as people.
  - Someone talks about themselves every time (5m)
- Team lunches.

  - Eat lunch together even if on laptop
  - Share your stuff
  - Have a room booked, and encourage it to happen.

- Include PM and other functions in team meeting.
- Keep calling out peoples strengths (team will copy)

#### Engineering/Operational Excellence

#### Strategic group alignment

- Retrospectives
- PM alignment critical
  - Daily interactions
  - Drag PM desk close to mine
- Leadership weekly priority
  - Are we in sync with PM, and
- Internal Project Status Meeting
  - Everyone knows what is going on, and can audit and help it track.

### What process hasn't worked?

- Leadership all int the room audit mechanism.
  - People want to look good.
  - Can’t guess what leaders want to see
  - Everyone not paying attention unless it’s their turn.
- Web lab Removal
  - You put something in yourself, and it falls apart.
- Cross team design review
  - Too many people in the room.
  - Not clear if the goal is sign off, or if the goal is education.
  - Too many rat holes
  - **Goal is update the bosses**
- Volunteer, distributed ownership on a painful fix:
  - Missing metrics
  - Weblabs
  - No, generate a table and track monthly.
  - Letting tasks not be in our bug tracker - often drop.
  - “I’ll just do it” — no need to get it the past.

### How do you institute the right process at the right time? How do you know when you need something more formal?

I’m usually error on the lack of process. E.g. Let people volunteer to fix and drive. And it doesn’t happen “Best Intentions Don’t Work”

- I try to figure out how to keep it on high ownership, not on letting it drop on the floor.
- When I expect it to work, and it isn’t.
- Force the usage of the bar when not present. E.g. push on that.

### Have they ever removed process? Why or why not?

- Yes, group retros - team hated it, it was too big, and it didn’t make sense to teams were too different.
- IC’s coming to a group status meeting. Reduced to just seniors of the teams, and focused on them.
- Switch from “group status report” to rotating meetings, but that made it worse as they never showed up.

## Part 6: Hiring

### What are you looking for in an engineer when you recruit?

Most companies have their “competencies” they test for. But I abstract it down to:

- Smart (Can code, understands)
  - Teach me something
  - Walk through X, and Y, how do you, explain me the trade offs.
- Get things done (wants to ship, owns it):
  - What matters to them
  - Tell me something hard you did.
- EQ: (Not an asshole, Continuous Learning, Sees impact off his action, self aware o how eels)
  - Tell me a time you got in a fight
  - Tell me the hardest feedback you received.

### Do they prefer to hire only experienced folks?

I need a pipeline of developers for mentorship, fan out and succession planning.

Need a Principal per 30 people.
Ratio Senior: SDE-II: SDE-I (1,2,2) => ten person team: 2, 4, 4.

Everyone grows by learning and teaching. Lots of rules
A crappy job for SDE-K is a growth opportunity for SDE-(K-1)
SDE-IIIs want to think hard and lead
SDE-I bring energy and excitement, but still dependent.
SDE-IIs do the bulk of the work.

Ideally, people grow from SDE-I -> SDE-III on a team, so much knowledge transfer and opportunity.

### Are they more comfortable with generalists or specialists?

Generalists - 99% of time

1. Industry changes to much.
2. Mostly about Architecture/Design and SDL and coding, domain and language easy to learn.

Specialist - 1% on very specific teams.

1. File system
2. Distributed system transaction processing.
3. Firmware engineers

Want full stack teams:

FE -> Learn the customer empathy through user interactions
BE -> Learn the tech chops of complex system.

### How do you think about hiring?

Priority list 1) Full blown Site Outage 2) Recruiting 3) Everything else.

Recruiting is ultimately product sales, where you're selling your team.

Most important part of sales:

1. The product: Product you're building, team (culture and people), yourself.

2. Funnel: Inbound Marketing, Referrals, high touch, post sales support.

### How have you optimized the recruiting process in the past? Have they thought about the recruiting funnel and how you can optimize different parts of it?

- Top of Funnel
  - Interview events
  - Internal Talks
  - Linked in Posts
  - Linked in Appreciation
  - Linked in Articles
  - Always help recruiting
  - Connect to warm candidates
  - Go grab coffee with them.
  - Mentorship of folks, volunteer for mentorship
  - Intern Talk
- Mid Funnel
  - Post interview - magic trick, after interview lets make time to chat
  - Push to get interview done ASAP
  - Push to get results to candidate ASAP
  - Walk out of interview connect on linked in and chat with them.
- Bottom of the Funnel
  - Focus on the needs of the candidate, then talk about how job can solve their needs.
  - Beer/Coffee/Call
  - Share what I have
  - Talk to my team.
  - Come out and have lunch with my team.
  - Multi Sell job come to my
  - Focus on

### What are their thoughts on structured interview loops vs. non-structured free-form loops?

- External Structured

  - Coding
  - Design
  - Leadership skills - most important
  - Self aware - earns trust.

- Internal, Structured but Different

- Novel ideas
  - Do code reviews
  - Do a mock interview + debrief

## Part 7: Firing and Performance Management

### How do you deal with people performance issues?

### Coach employee back to success

- Private

### Have you ever had to implement a PIP (performance improvement plan)? What are your thoughts on it?

Three "Players" in this situation:

- The team
  - Weak performer means others on team have to cover both in mentoring, and picking up dropped ball.
  - Sets a bad example for the team
  - Team knows the weak, and dislikes it.
  - Need to mitigate impact of week employee.
- The struggling employee
  - Should not be a surprise from manager. Should have already gone through role guidelines and gaps.
  - Clear set of gaps, and expectation for required improvement.
  - Let employee 'self discover' gaps and judge, but you must set down the truth.
  - Progressively lay out process, so they know where they're at and what happens next.
  - Remember being in the wrong role SUCKS. Employee is going home after long day, and feeling like shit (rinse and repeat)
  - One in right role - will feel great. Seen lots of times this happens.
  - Help them know it's the wrong role, but they have lots of strengths (look we hired you), and you'll be well loved elsewhere.
  - Help them with how to find change.
- The manager.
  - Emotionally draining. But you own giving them an opportunity not their success.
  - When they're in the wrong role, best thing that happen is getting them to a place where they are successful.
  - Can be time and energy intensive, robs the team and good employees of your energy.
  - Ensure criteria for demonstrating employees recover is sufficient. Get pre-agreement on criteria with your organizational leaders.
  - Remember, all employee's getting into this process will improve because they are being chased. Ensure it's not temporary.

* In general, if you're on PIP, you've been going home and feeling like shit, who wants to do that?
* Get into right role, almost always feels better
* Shouldn’t be a surprise, see it coming from a mile away.
* Help them get a job
* Lay out process, and help w/mock interviews and general interviewing advice.
* Help understand strengths.

## Random topics

### Should industry have architects

- Best discussion on the topic [Tech Lead vs Architect](/software-leadership-roles)
- Physical world vs Software:
  - Structural Engineer
    - MSFT Software Architect
    - Though shall not pass.
    - Enforce "Building Code" - Beam must be 1 foot thick. No variance, no pass. Built for the average.
  - Physical Architect == Convert Customer Desire (Product Owner) into a maintainable buildable system (tech lead, engineering manger).
    - Should be owned by the team.
    - Knows the reality of the system better then Structural Engineer.
- The gaps - inexperienced, (or lazy) teams
  - You give the rope, but the team is accountable (hard w/rotation)
  - Design reviews
- Good use of "Architects"
  - Guidance - not sign off.
  - Technology SME's for advice.
  - Long term vision and industry understanding.
  - Consult on large projects.
  - Mentoring of senior (not PE) employees
- Covered by great TPMs, drive large scale company changes.

### How do you bootstrap technical leadership in an organization that has no public titles?

### What are the pros/cons of public vs. private titles?

- MSFT went through this
- World better w/o title

Public Pro
_ Pride for promotions
_ Signal of organization influence (although you can kind of figure it out) \* Shortcut to find senior folks when don’t know the team.

- Cons
  - When “title” doesn’t match reality.
  - Folks get positional authority
  - Jockeying for Promo when doesn’t matter.
  - Frustration in thinking problem is title not blah.
  - Being right, but ignored
