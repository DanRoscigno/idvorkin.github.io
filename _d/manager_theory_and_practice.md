This is the draft post being migrated to [here](/the-manager-book). Managing is hard. Lessons are hard earned, and should be cherished. This series of posts is designed to draw out my opinions on management. It reminds me how to behave, and encourages others to poke into my reasoning and help me improve. I'm using an interview format for this post, as that's an easy way to start.

## Part #1: What does a manager do

### Horizontal vs Vertical: What specific types of duties would you like to do help with at this company?

Beyond "My team", there are several non-tech initiatives I like to drive, 1) recruiting 2) interns 3) inclusion and diversity.
On the tech side: Iterative, Metrics Driven, Hard off the wheel automation.

Recruiting

- Hiring Event
- Weekly posts

Moments

- Team Breakfasts
- Celebrations

Interns

- Team allocation
- Events
- Ship Gifts
- Help w/weak manager w/perf management.
- Checkin
- Major Talk

Culture

- Inclusion
- Always improving.

## Part 2: Managing and Developing People

### How do you keep people motivated?

- Autonomy
  - You are the owner
  - All decision need your sign off
  - Coach from behind (here's success, here's how I'd say it, what are the consequences, misses)
  - Know team has your back.
  - Protecting from harmful rays of upper management and business
  - Only clear out as much as required
- Mastery
  - Training
  - Bigger and Bigger Opportunities
  - Bigger and bigger exposure
- Purpose
  - Focus on the why
  - Call out the impact
  - Share the success with the team
  - Share success with partners and boss
- Coaching + Career Growth
  - Catching people doing things right.
  - 110% of capability but clarify doing 110% vs 80%
- Moments
  - Constant celebrating people doing stuff fun
  - Hack-a-thons
  - Playing cards for appreciation
  - Managers making breakfast

### Challenging feedback?

Why is feedback challenging? 1) It's a surprise 2) They don't want to hear it 3) They don't think you have their best interests in mind.

Types of tough conversations:

Performance, Charter, Re-org (me leaving), Lay Offs.

1. Surprise - see around corners, and bring up anything I see ASAP, and foreshadow. Meet frequently, know what people care about.
2. Attack the messenger - High Trust, Know how the person likes to hear stuff. Address what they care about.
3. Don't want to hear it - Self Aware, Think I have their best interest in mind, Put it in terms they want to hear it.
4. Over dramatize - Anticipate what they'll care about, pre-address.

### What is the point of a 1:1?

Computers produce nothing, developers produce code. Business produce nothing PMs, other functions produce stuff.

I produce nothing, my output is the output of the team, and the team is the sum of the people. My ability to get the most value from my people is through my relationship with the people. If they trust me whole heartily, they'll tell me stuff I need to know, and I'll be able to understand how best to use them/influence them/inspire them. So, all my 1:1's start with What's on your mind - what ever they have we talk through. based on time and place we'll do X, Y.

For 1:1's for my team, the employees owns the Agenda, however I will nudge them. I like to spend time

- Building relationships
- Providing Larger Context
- Having confidential discussions on concerns and questions.
- Coaching strategically
- Coaching tactically.

I also have some special 1:1s:

- Leadership card evaluation exercise
- Career discussions - A discussion around what we should be focused on for the next 6-18 months.
- Reviewing role guidelines - to help ensure we're on the same page about tactical gaps.

### How do you identify engineers who could make good managers? How do you help them develop?

### How do you think of developing people?

SDE-I:

Not a lot of variance, Make sure they have a solid mentor, and opportunity after opportunity to round out their knowledge. Big focus:

- We hired you because you're smart+really good. I you can't understand something, it's probably the presenter doesn't understand it well, as opposed to you not understanding"
- You help them close gaps, sharpen their understanding by teaching it to you
- You are new, and need to learn and need to spend a bunch of time asking for help and guidance. I have one rule - you must come with a bad idea (which will start becoming good ideas). You fail when you bring nothing, you ace it when you bring a bad idea. We'll help you develop that bad idea, and help sharpen your thinking skill.
- "You have a fresh perspective - If something doesn't make sense ask, for us, we're like fish in water, so challenge our assumptions".

SDE-II:

Now it's about how are you helping the team, growing your contributions. Bigger experiences, maybe out side the org, both to build your skills, and increase your org visibility. Double down on super powers, close red flags and blockers. Very satisfying to watch people "blossom" into leaders.

- How do you make the team better?
- What are you gonna be known for?
- You're the owner, you'll do everything and I work for you. What help do you need
- Do shadow coaching, where I might be writing/pr-doing work but they do the send/take the credit

SDE-III:

Here you're getting people are at a career level and are happy with a lot of what they're doing. Here they're deciding how much they want to grow, and where they want to improve. Here it's discussing with mentors, and how we want to split responsibility and cover each other. Also opportunities for what they own for the group (30-60+) e.g. security or process or etc.

### How do you handle a great engineer with communication problems?

- High Order: Goal is not "communication style", but ability to influence.

- Types of communication problems
  - Clarity of thought
    - Big gap - but doesn't sound like the criteria
  - Not listening to others
  - ESL -
  - Written
  - Verbal
    - Toast masters
    - Pre-write thoughts
    - Use pictures
    - Say not great on my feet
  - Slow in situations

### How do you handle someone who really wants a promotion but isn't ready?

- Surprises are **BAD**:

  - Haven't set clear expectations.
  - Requires mini RCA

- Goal:

  - Engineer comes to conclusion himself
  - Engineers feels on track
  - Engineer aspires to get to that level
  - Engineer doesn't want to be over leveled
  - Engineer is self aware
  - Engineer gets new opportunities/support required.

- Start w assume engineer right - lets look at the criteria together.

  - Now or next 1:1?

- Review role guidelines

  - Ask for self evaluation
  - Go over with examples together
  - Ask "How would you describe your behavior vs someone else's"
  - Ask what gaps do you see

- Call out positive examples from engineers @ Level + 1

### Best hire of your career

### How did you grow top talent

### What do you do when a team completely disagrees with the founder/VP on the direction of a product?

### What is your ideal culture?

### How do you make a good culture?

- Model myself
  - On All the Pages
  - If team is working I'm working
  - When I make mistakes I apologies
  - If I drop the ball I make it clear.
  - When someone does well I celebrate and call out.
- Catch people doings things right
  - Coaching stuff
- Put it front and center
- Let team take ownership of it.
- Incite pride and purpose
- Repeat/Repeat/Repeat

## Part 3: Business Acumen

### Discuss this companies trajectory as you see it. What choices do they think they're good and bad at? Would you have done things differently? What problems do you see coming up in the future?

**Zillow:**

**Facebook:**

**Google:**

**Amazon:**

**Microsoft:**

**Linked In**

## Part 4: Self Assessment and Weakness

### Disagreement answer format

- Push back good because of blind spots
- They thought
- I thought
- So I
- And this happened
- Leanings
- Afterwords I circled back and they thought

### What was the biggest 'mental model' shift you had from IC to manager?

- Auditing
- Value of process and checklists
- Team being the peer leads.

### Top Weakness

### Get in a fight with your boss

#### Music Video

#### Moderation Reactive vs Proactive

#### Co boss

#### Shutdown alternate platforms

#### Break big bang creator studio down into

### Get in a fight technical

#### Service split and shared component

  #### Need SDE-III to do work that was below him.

#### Architect won't let us launch without committing to next release.

    * Architect need to save face.
    * Still doing the change, but add a "design" for next release, and we both knew it was dumb.

#### Variable Heart Beat

### Get in a fight PM

#### Creator Portal initial launch - We're acceptable to ship with several gaps.

#### Who needs file compression for video upload.

#### Brands

- Need to have experiment and hypothesis.
- stop doing tech sales pitch,
- never commit my team without my explicit sign off
- don't bully my people

### Get in a fight with other

#### Smile w/Legal.

### Think of a mistake or failure you’ve made in the past two years. What did you learn from it and/or do differently in the future?

#### Push GSAT when parent team though it was a bad idea.

#### Launching Creator Portal

- Major Feature (still hadn’t established full trust)

- Launching of WAMD by keyword - precision and recall hard.
  - Testing w/Non peak traffic, precision high, recall low. Happy with that.
  - Late brought up could have very different traffic pattern for peak (couldn’t pre-test)
  - Came up with Plan
    - Hourly monitoring for gaps
    - 3 types of shutdown switches (all off, blacklist bad, whitelist good)
    - 99% latency.
- Next time
  - Will run same protocol again this year.
  - Come up with an offline computation model for next prime day.

**Leanings - How I handled the “Though shalt not pass” conversation from my VP**

- Launching Charity Giving
  - VP decided we’ll need to do video sharing to FB/Twitter
  - Boss didn’t push back, just pass through.
  - Yup, my mistake. How can we get this working.
  - Decent idea, but My team was 100% booked, and no experience.
  - Begged other leads for an expert in this area. Spent 2 days to see if it was possible, found out it wasn’t possible for 2 days, then got sign off from a VP, made a nice package for my boss, who brought it up the tree.

#### Over committing my team

- Q4 2018 - Wanted to do charity
  - Committed team to deliver - “Lets take 2 weeks and make sure we can do this” , team agreed. Then we pushed hard, and hot but we’d make it and start converging.
  - As got closer, standard cut stuff.
  - New, requests from other parts of the organization - must do I18N, can’t get it off our plate
  - Must do a new time of coupon (which was already cut)
  - Load testing want completely wrong.
  - **Everything** went wrong
- Team killed themselves till thanksgiving
  - Which they didn’t mind because of the purpose off the launch.
  - HOWEVER: Said we’d get a break post Thanksgiving. And we didn’t, get more stuff put on us I18N and another coupon type.
  - Couldn’t get it negotiated off my team (Amazon — Grr!!)

**Learning for next time**

- Target done 1.5 months early (will slip to 1 months, and then need the E2E time, or bring new features in)
- Agreement on what features we’d cut if required when we got closer.
- Left in more slack so didn’t get pushed over
- Shared data up with what happened last time w/data and wouldn’t over commit.
- Stopped other teams from over committing.
- Done with 2 weeks to spare.

### What would a report/peer/manager feedback on you be? Strengths, areas for development, etc.

- Report
  - Care, Great Advice, People First, Strong People chops
  - Gaps:
    - Organization - my desk is a mess, and I miss stuff (Mitigate: Push my whole team to audit, constant list of top risks)
- Boss

  - Same as reports
  - Hiring - Wow
  - Impressive handling of complex situations.
  - Commit Faster when you aren’t in agreement
    - Customer -> Team > Business vs Customer > Team > Business
  - Start by assuming I’m right, instead of me being wrong
    - Exact opposite o what I tell me, I need them to assume I”m wrong due to positional authority
  - Don’t be so harsh on “slow” partners.
    - I stay don’t get blocked and want to ship, people who are in agreement love me. People that don’t I’ll Figure out how to get around.
  - (Less experienced) Be less autonomous.

    - Lots of ideas, change fast, check with me more often.

  - Peer
    - Want to ship
    - How do you pull that off
  - Good
    - Team loves you
    - Creative
  - Gaps
    - Going too Fast.
    - Keep me in the loop
    - Be more risk averse

### How would you assess if someone is a good manager?

Using the same metrics I apply to myself. For the how I'd:

- Look at "employee surveys"
- Look at their business results (scorecards and KPI)
- Look at their operational load and tickets/pages/etc
- Interview their employees, PMs, and business partners, and partner teams
- Ask them about their architecture
- Ask them the interview questions

## Part 5: Process and Mechanism

### Process Patterns

- Turn input into outputs
- How to measure success of the process, what will you inspect, when will you adjust,
- Who is the owner?
- What other process is this similar to, can we co-coalesce with something else?
- How will you get buy in
- How to get team to accept
- (Bright spot, then land and expand)
- Sounds like good intentions
- Culture vs Process

### Process Anti-Patterns:

- TODO: Invert this
- Disenfranchising ownership

  - Nothing more powerful then a motivated engineer, don’t let process take that away.

- Having humans do what computers can do

  - Only have so much "process execution budget" don't waste it
    - Use auto style for code review styles
    - Gather data from bug systems instead of having humans do it.
    - Automated tests vs human execution
    - Multiple copies of the same data

- Free up developers to not solve known issues - freedom for more stuff
- Someone **owns** a process for a quarter so they can own it and make it better.

### What kind of process have you followed in the past and what has worked well for you?

Process per "output desired"

#### Design+ Arch Reviews: Minimal rework, high quality assets

- Ensure that tech assets are high quality and require minimal re-work.
- Ensure team gets cross trained.
- Catch stuff as early as possible
- Get developers used to being on the whiteboard
- Really a preview, not a review.

#### Team gelling

- Team meetings,
  - Focus on reflection.
  - Focus on what ever is the "mood" of the team.
  - Reflect as people.
  - Someone talks about themselves every time (5m)
- Team lunches.

  - Eat lunch together even if on laptop
  - Share your stuff
  - Have a room booked, and encourage it to happen.

- Include PM and other functions in team meeting.
- Keep calling out peoples strengths (team will copy)

#### Engineering/Operational Excellence

1.  How do we know our customer is having a good day? 2) How do we maximize our velocity 3) How do we keep our developers happy.

- Know what's going on:
- On all the pages - Strong appreciation for boots on the ground reality.
- Write up for all outages, COE for major outages - Maximize value of mistakes, don't make them twice.
  - For all customer impacting event, review w/Customer Impact, root cause understood, and commitment when to address.
- Observability
  - How do we get a page next time.
  - How do we see what's going on.
- Testing systems.
  - Very high leverage active
- Deep dive to do a check-in
- Do it all myself to see what's broken and understand where to invest.

#### Strategic group alignment

- Retrospectives
- PM alignment critical
  - Daily interactions
  - Drag PM desk close to mine
- Leadership weekly priority
  - Are we in sync with PM, and
- Internal Project Status Meeting
  - Everyone knows what is going on, and can audit and help it track.

### What process hasn't worked?

- Leadership all int the room audit mechanism.
  - People want to look good.
  - Can’t guess what leaders want to see
  - Everyone not paying attention unless it’s their turn.
- Web lab Removal
  - You put something in yourself, and it falls apart.
- Cross team design review
  - Too many people in the room.
  - Not clear if the goal is sign off, or if the goal is education.
  - Too many rat holes
  - **Goal is update the bosses**
- Volunteer, distributed ownership on a painful fix:
  - Missing metrics
  - Weblabs
  - No, generate a table and track monthly.
  - Letting tasks not be in our bug tracker - often drop.
  - “I’ll just do it” — no need to get it the past.

### How do you institute the right process at the right time? How do you know when you need something more formal?

I’m usually error on the lack of process. E.g. Let people volunteer to fix and drive. And it doesn’t happen “Best Intentions Don’t Work”

- I try to figure out how to keep it on high ownership, not on letting it drop on the floor.
- When I expect it to work, and it isn’t.
- Force the usage of the bar when not present. E.g. push on that.

### Have they ever removed process? Why or why not?

- Yes, group retros - team hated it, it was too big, and it didn’t make sense to teams were too different.
- IC’s coming to a group status meeting. Reduced to just seniors of the teams, and focused on them.
- Switch from “group status report” to rotating meetings, but that made it worse as they never showed up.

## Part 6: Hiring

### What are you looking for in an engineer when you recruit?

Most companies have their “competencies” they test for. But I abstract it down to:

- Smart (Can code, understands)
  - Teach me something
  - Walk through X, and Y, how do you, explain me the trade offs.
- Get things done (wants to ship, owns it):
  - What matters to them
  - Tell me something hard you did.
- EQ: (Not an asshole, Continuous Learning, Sees impact off his action, self aware o how eels)
  - Tell me a time you got in a fight
  - Tell me the hardest feedback you received.

### Do they prefer to hire only experienced folks?

I need a pipeline of developers for mentorship, fan out and succession planning.

Need a Principal per 30 people.
Ratio Senior: SDE-II: SDE-I (1,2,2) => ten person team: 2, 4, 4.

Everyone grows by learning and teaching. Lots of rules
A crappy job for SDE-K is a growth opportunity for SDE-(K-1)
SDE-IIIs want to think hard and lead
SDE-I bring energy and excitement, but still dependent.
SDE-IIs do the bulk of the work.

Ideally, people grow from SDE-I -> SDE-III on a team, so much knowledge transfer and opportunity.

### Are they more comfortable with generalists or specialists?

Generalists - 99% of time

1. Industry changes to much.
2. Mostly about Architecture/Design and SDL and coding, domain and language easy to learn.

Specialist - 1% on very specific teams.

1. File system
2. Distributed system transaction processing.
3. Firmware engineers

Want full stack teams:

FE -> Learn the customer empathy through user interactions
BE -> Learn the tech chops of complex system.

### How do you think about hiring?

Priority list 1) Full blown Site Outage 2) Recruiting 3) Everything else.

Recruiting is ultimately product sales, where you're selling your team.

Most important part of sales:

1. The product: Product you're building, team (culture and people), yourself.

2. Funnel: Inbound Marketing, Referrals, high touch, post sales support.

### How have you optimized the recruiting process in the past? Have they thought about the recruiting funnel and how you can optimize different parts of it?

- Top of Funnel
  - Interview events
  - Internal Talks
  - Linked in Posts
  - Linked in Appreciation
  - Linked in Articles
  - Always help recruiting
  - Connect to warm candidates
  - Go grab coffee with them.
  - Mentorship of folks, volunteer for mentorship
  - Intern Talk
- Mid Funnel
  - Post interview - magic trick, after interview lets make time to chat
  - Push to get interview done ASAP
  - Push to get results to candidate ASAP
  - Walk out of interview connect on linked in and chat with them.
- Bottom of the Funnel
  - Focus on the needs of the candidate, then talk about how job can solve their needs.

## Part 7: Firing and Performance Management

### How do you deal with people performance issues?

### Coach employee back to success

- Private

### Have you ever had to implement a PIP (performance improvement plan)? What are your thoughts on it?

Three "Players" in this situation:

- The team
  - Weak performer means others on team have to cover both in mentoring, and picking up dropped ball.
  - Sets a bad example for the team
  - Team knows the weak, and dislikes it.
  - Need to mitigate impact of week employee.
- The struggling employee
  - Should not be a surprise from manager. Should have already gone through role guidelines and gaps.
  - Clear set of gaps, and expectation for required improvement.
  - Let employee 'self discover' gaps and judge, but you must set down the truth.
  - Progressively lay out process, so they know where they're at and what happens next.
  - Remember being in the wrong role SUCKS. Employee is going home after long day, and feeling like shit (rinse and repeat)
  - One in right role - will feel great. Seen lots of times this happens.
  - Help them know it's the wrong role, but they have lots of strengths (look we hired you), and you'll be well loved elsewhere.
  - Help them with how to find change.
- The manager.
  - Emotionally draining. But you own giving them an opportunity not their success.
  - When they're in the wrong role, best thing that happen is getting them to a place where they are successful.
  - Can be time and energy intensive, robs the team and good employees of your energy.
  - Ensure criteria for demonstrating employees recover is sufficient. Get pre-agreement on criteria with your organizational leaders.
  - Remember, all employee's getting into this process will improve because they are being chased. Ensure it's not temporary.

* In general, if you're on PIP, you've been going home and feeling like shit, who wants to do that?
* Get into right role, almost always feels better
* Shouldn’t be a surprise, see it coming from a mile away.
* Help them get a job
* Lay out process, and help w/mock interviews and general interviewing advice.
* Help understand strengths.
