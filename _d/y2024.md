### Major Projects

- Finish What I wish I knew at 42

{%include summarize-page.html src="/42" %}

- Work on my bestie/simulator/smilebox

{%include summarize-page.html src="/ai-bestie" %}

- "Publish" EM Handbook: be the EM everyone wants

{%include summarize-page.html src="/manager-book" %}
{%include summarize-page.html src="/write-book" %}

### August Vacation

This summer I'll have 5 weeks off (maybe 6), and I'd like to spend them wisely. I was thinking I'd do 1 week with each kid independently and then spend 3 weeks with the family. Sounds like a blast.

(I guess when I'm driving, I'll need to bring some 32 KG Kettlebells with me)

**Week with Zach**

**Week with Amelia**

**The whole family**

**How to write a book** (in progress)

{%include summarize-page.html src="/write-book" %}

Dogs of war and Bear head

Interesting scifi series about using genetic engineering instead of robots for soldiers. As it's harder to "hack them". Book 2 gets much more interseting.
