I have a problem, an [addiction](/addiction), an addiction so detrimental to quality of life, it should be described as a disease. This disease is not being present. There are many symptoms of the disease, but today I'm going to talk about my most frequent symptoms, my body at home, but my mind at work.

Imagine if you had to work 80 hours a week, every week, but you wasted 40 of those hours being stuck and making no progress. That's what happens when my body is at home, but my mind is at work. It's obvious this flares up when things are going poorly at work, and non-obvious when things are going well. Having my mind at work is a waste - my life outside of work suffers, and no work is competed. Ironically, work suffers because you never clear your head.

Even though I have the my mind not being present disease, there are times when I'm symptom free. I'm usually symptom free after a few weeks of [vacation](/time-off), or when something so amazing happens at home that I'm knocked into the present moment, even if briefly. For example when my daughter, Amelia, gives me one of her incredible hugs.

I know [medicines](/emotional-health) that reduce flare ups of the disease, and when taken consistently keep the disease at bay. The medicine tastes terrible though, and because I'm acclimatised to the disease, I don't even realize it's degrading my quality of life.

Knowing and committing is the half the battle, and of late the reduction in quality of life from the disease has been apparent. If you're worried about me, don't be -- I don't think the disease has been worse of late. This clarity has come from this year's focus on emotional health. My increased self-awareness helps bring clarity to emotional constructs that are holding me back.

Thus, I'm working hard to reduce symptoms of the disease -- in fact, I'm incredibly happy to say that since I've been on vacation, I haven't thought about work since day one. This may sound like a low bar, but almost all of my life, for the first few weeks of vacation I haven't been able to forget about work.

Future posts will document my journey, and the [activities](/emotional-health) that support this.
