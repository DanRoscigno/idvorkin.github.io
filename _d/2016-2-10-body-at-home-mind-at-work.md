I have a problem, an [addiction](/addiction), an addiction so detrimental to quality of life, it should be described as a disease. This disease is not being present. There are many symptoms of the disease, but today I'm going to talk about my most frequent symptoms, my body at home, but my mind at work.

Imagine if you had to work 80 hours a week, every week, but you wasted 40 of those hours being stuck and making no progress. That's what happens when my body is at home, but my mind is at work. It's obvious this flares up when things are going poorly at work, and non-obvious when things are going well. Having my mind at work is a waste - my life outside of work suffers, and no work is completed. Ironically, work suffers because you never clear your head.

Even though I have the my mind not being present disease, there are times when I'm symptom free. I'm usually symptom free after a few weeks of [vacation](/time-off), or when something so amazing happens at home that I'm knocked into the present moment, even if briefly. For example, when my daughter, Amelia, gives me one of her incredible hugs.

I know [medicines](/emotional-health) that reduce flare ups of the disease, and when taken consistently keep the disease at bay. The medicine tastes terrible though, and because I'm acclimatized to the disease, I don't even realize it's degrading my quality of life.

Knowing and committing is half the battle, and of late the reduction in quality of life from the disease has been apparent. If you're worried about me, don't be -- I don't think the disease has been worse of late. This clarity has come from this year's focus on emotional health. My increased self-awareness helps bring clarity to emotional constructs that are holding me back.

Thus, I'm working hard to reduce symptoms of the disease -- in fact, I'm incredibly happy to say that since I've been on vacation, I haven't thought about work since day one. This may sound like a low bar, but almost all of my life, for the first few weeks of vacation I haven't been able to forget about work.

Future posts will document my journey, and the [activities](/emotional-health) that support this.

### Thinking about work at home is a habit

**Woah, someone told me something that blew my mind**  Thinking about work at home is just a habit!  That means a few things, 1/ there was a time this brought me some value (need to introspect to see if it still does), 2/ I need to apply all my understanding/tools of habits.

{%include summarize-page.html src="/habits" %}

The Atomic habit model looks like the below, with the generic device on how to remove the bad habit:

| State    | Description                                                            | Change                                               |
|----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Cue      | Idle/Mindless Time                                                     | Make it invisible                                    |
| Craving  | Make progress on my work                                               | Make it displeasing (I don't think this is the case) |
| Response | Thinking About work , often spinning                                   | Make it hard (I don't think this is the case)        |
| Reward   | Don't think there is one anymore but back in the day solving a problem | Make it unsatisfying                                 |


When most of the habit is in your head, it's pretty tough to apply the habit change model. It's very difficult to stop thinking about something, your best shot is thinking about something else. (Try this; Picture a yellow elephant for 10seconds, OK, now try not to think of it - good luck).

Perhaps the thing to think about instead of how to change the habit, is how to create a new habit? Letting the old habit become the cue for the new habit. Trying out something:

| State    | Description                                                                                               |
|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Cue      | Thinking about Work                                                                                       |
| Craving  | Not miss a work insight, not spending more time at work than I want                                       |
| Response | Write down what I'm thinking so I can process it when I'm at work, or realize I'm already have it in plan |
| Reward   | Feel confident I'm not missing anything and I'm putting the right investment into work                    |

Will keep you posted if this works.
