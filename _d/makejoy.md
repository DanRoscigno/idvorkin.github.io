Bringing joy for others is my thing. From my eulogy - _Igor lived to see eyes go wide and mouths gape with wonder. Igor especially loved it when strangers got drawn in against their inner objections, or when a kid having a meltdown, or a grown up looking miserable, forgot their troubles._

## Theory

### Things that bring most people joy

- Babes
- Baby Animals
- Bubbles
- Reacting to a smile
- Beautiful singing
- Singing out loud
- Christmas Carols

### Attributes of Joy

### Joy versus pleasure

Pleasure is the release of tension. The going from anticipation of something positive to getting it. Orgasm, Getting to pee when you have to go. Eating a very tasty cake.

Joy is different, there's no tension, and it's involuntary. You can experience Joy against your will.

Joy: - Is involuntary - Acts on you - Better when it provides connection -

Joy requirements - Safety - Non-threatening

Building Safety - Validation of others, - Don't want to feel dumb for enjoying joy.

- Kids experience more joy because:
  - Thing are more novel
  - Naturally feel safe
  - Less need for validation of peers
  - Except things to be wholesome and good
