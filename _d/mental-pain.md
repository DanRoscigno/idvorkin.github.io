Pain is in the brain as they say, which is especially true for mental pains. Pain isn't the enemy though, pain is a signal. The pain system, when working properly brings our perspective to a problem so that we can deal with it. However, pain can also be phantom pain, meaning it is being applied when it should not be, or chronic pain, which flairs up even though it is no longer providing value.

## The point of pain

## Pain vs Suffering

Humans need things to have meaning. To give our pain meaning, we usually add sufferening. Suffering is the made up story that transforms our pain from "I have a problem I need to address" to "he doesn't like me", "I'm screwed", "I'll never be able to show my face again".

Pain is a good thing, suffering, is the problem.

## Phantom vs Real Pain

## Misc topics

### Pride vs Self Confidence vs Hubris/Arrogance

Interesting - in Dr. Raphs's model, pride is good, arrogance is bad. The test for the boundary is "how impressive is the achievement?" [Pride ducking with you](/pride) is my post on pride and arrogance.
