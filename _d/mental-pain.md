Pain is in the brain as they say, which is especially true for mental pains. Pain isn't the enemy though, pain is a signal. The pain system, when working properly brings our perspective to a problem so that we can deal with it. However, pain can also be phantom pain, meaning it is being applied when it should not be, or chronic pain, which flairs up even though it is no longer providing value.

## The point of pain

## Pain vs Suffering

Humans need things to have meaning. To give our pain meaning, we usually add suffering. Suffering is the made up story that transforms our pain from "I have a problem I need to address" to "he doesn't like me", "I'm screwed", "I'll never be able to show my face again".

Pain is a good thing, suffering, is the problem.

## Phantom vs Real Pain

## Types of pain

### Desire to control

### Doubt

### Disappointment

## Where's the pain

### Self

#### Control: Anxiety

{%include summarize-page.html src="/anxiety" %}

#### Doubt: Self Doubt

#### Disappointment: Self disappointment

### Other - From you, to you

#### Control: Controlling, loss of autonomy

#### Doubt: Abandonment, Taking fore granted

#### Disappointment: Guilt/[shame](/shame)/Embarrassed, Unfair, 2

Remember, just because you can feel guilt/shame/embarrassed, doesn't mean you should.

### Process - In your life

#### Control: [Anxiety](/anxiety)

{%include summarize-page.html src="/anxiety" %}

#### Doubt: Mistrust and Meaninglessness

#### Disappointment: Guilt/[shame](/shame)/Embarrassed, Unfair

## Pain and Suffering without progress

Pain is often a signal to drive progress (like need to study for interviews, getting done performance reviews, etc) Once you've completed the progress, pain (and likely suffering) can go away

However, through the power of procrastination/resistance you can have the worst of all worlds. The pain and suffering without progress

{%include summarize-page.html src="/frog" %}

The more lack of progress, the more pain and suffering, and then guilt and self disappointment. Getting things done helps resolve this:

But some crib notes

**Allocate concrete time and goals** Best efforts to get stuff done, won't happen

**Give yourself large blocks of time** Don't expect to grind through something painful in 30 minutes. This wouldn't be painful if it's easy to do, you'll often need time to get in the groove before you can make progress. Give your self large blocks of time - like 2 hours at a time

**Don't take a step forward and a step backwards** A great example of this is dieting. I'll often diet for half a day and then gorge the other half. As a result a half day of pain, with no gain. Either diet that day or don't. Similar, if you're studying write down your notes. If you just "think about it", but don't do a partial completion - complete waste

## Fueling the fire, adding meaning

### Meaning: From Pain to Suffering

### Meaning squared: From Suffering to Misery

#### Victim: Nothing I can do

#### Unique: The world is not fair to me

## The positive analogs

### Pain to pleasure

### Suffering to satisfaction

### Misery to Hubris

## Loneliness

- Boredom is the loss of connection
- [Loniness is bad for your health](https://www.cdc.gov/aging/publications/features/lonely-older-adults.html)

## Misc topics

### Pride vs Self Confidence vs Hubris/Arrogance

Interesting - in Dr. Raphs's model, pride is good, arrogance is bad. The test for the boundary is "how impressive is the achievement?" [Pride ducking with you](/pride) is my post on pride and arrogance.
