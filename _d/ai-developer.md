ML Engineer is a hot new word. I think it refers to engineers who train and deploy models. I heard the word AI developer the other day and I don't know if it's defined yet, but I'll refer to it as AI application engineers. People who use AI to sovle use cases.

## Use Cases and Applications

- Writing git commit messages
- Reviewing changes in a repo over a period of time (kind of a special case of git commit message)

## Tech Deep Dive - Models

### Model and Service Dashboards

- [Open AI Usage](https://platform.openai.com/usage)
- [Claude Usage](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/usage)
- Gemini Usage - Sheesh I can't even figure it out
- [VAPI](https://dashboard.vapi.ai/billing) - for voice access
- [Modal](https://modal.com/settings/idvorkin/usage) - For FaaS capability

### Tools + Libraries

- Langchain
  - Gives you a unified API to use multiple models

### Commercial vs Open Source Models

### Groq

- Groq is really excisting because it's crazy fast. Like 200 Tokens/S. But it can only run open source models, so much less useful. Looks like it can run

## Data Access

- RAG
- Raptor
- DSpy
