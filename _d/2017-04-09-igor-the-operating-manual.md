I've learned what I like, how I want to spend my energy,and how I want to be thinking about my life. I've learned my roles, reasonable expectations, and healthy ways to operate given my personality, behaviors, and frequently occurring situations. This post is a summary of those learnings - an operating manual if you will, reminding me how to think about, respond to and behave, so I can operate at maximum effectiveness and efficiency.

## Work

### Thoughts from joining Facebook

In 2020, I joined FB and it was great.

### Thoughts from joining Amazon

At the end of 2016, I joined [Amazon](/amazon) to learn the business of software, to learn to [write](/writing) and to live by the leadership principles. It was my first job outside of Microsoft where I'd worked for 15 years so it was a tough transition. Here are some things I needed to remind myself

### Realistic expectations for a new leader

Here are some things I needed to remind myself as I was working through my own [insecurity and imposter syndrome](/insecurity):

- I don't know how Amazon works - Duh, I was at my last job, Microsoft for 15 years, knew how everything worked, learned how everything evolved to where it was, and knew enough people to always be able to get done what I wanted.
- Leaders take a while to ramp up - that's why you end up with signing bonuses.
- It'll take a while to learn new skills
- Amazon is a very different culture from Microsoft. Sometimes I don't even realize I'm swimming against the current.

### IC skills to develop

- [Business Writing](/writing)
- [Design](/td/design)
- [Cloud first applications and SOA](/td/cloud-first-applications)
- [Data Systems](/td/data-systems)

### Manager skill to develop

From [Igor's book of manager](/the-manager-book):

_Managing is hard. Lessons are hard earned and should be cherished. This post is designed to make explicit, and improve behaviors and practices. It reminds us how to behave, and encourages continuous improvement._

As a new manager at Amazon, my top priorities:

- Hiring
- Growing my people
- Defining Success Qualitatively and Quantitatively.
- Setting the vision for the team

### [Dream Job](/dream-job)

### My super powers

#### Relationships

- Investing time in relationships always pays out. It can feel expensive, but it's always worth it.

#### Technical Depth and Breadth

#### Technical Best Practice

#### Ability to sanity test all tech stuff.

### My kryptonite

#### Bean counting

#### Committing and describing relative to ideal, not relative to reality.

#### Under estimating technical complexity

## Health and habits

Health - physical, emotional, cognitive and spiritual, is easy to understand but hard to maintain. My strategy to maintain health is [habits](/habits), but thanks to the [immutable laws of hard things](http://~/Immutable-Laws-Of-Hard), habits degrade without constant vigilance.

I spend lots of time thinking about how I should be working my habits, but often end up not doing them. In this case, the key is to stop moaning and restart 'em.

### [Physical](/physical-health)

### [Emotional](/emotional-health)

### [Cognitive](/writing)

### [Identity](/eulogy)

### [Hobbies](/hobby)

I've already got enough hobbies - biking, magic, juggling. I get my biking fix no problem.

### [Biking](/bike)

### [Magic](/magic)

### [Juggling](http://ig66.blogspot.com/2014/08/accomplishment-unlocked-juggling-file.html?q=torches)

## Morning Routine

At my best, I roll out of bed either when my eyes open or at 5am, what ever comes first.

I also love getting my morning hug from my kids, but now that Zach's older (9), I'm down to just getting the hugs from Amelia - who is 5.

### Weekend morning routine

On the weekends, the gym opens at 8, so it's essential I drink my coffee in my home office chair so I work on whatever is most important to me, often reading or writing. At 7:30 it's time to drag my but to the gym.

Post gym I'll either hit the coffee shop to do some more writing, or head home to spend the day with my family.

### Weekday morning routine

At my best, I roll out of bed either when my eyes open or at 5am, what ever comes first.

The gym opens at 5:30, and I try to be there by 6. After my work out, I often chillax with my next priority being walking the kids to school. Walking the kids to school has surprisingly been a major quality of life improvement for a very small impact to my day.

### Morning Kryptonite

I have two common failure modes to my morning routine.

- Starting my day by sitting in my easy chair drinking my coffee. This mindless activity has me skipping those things that are important to me.
- Hitting snooze when my alarm goes off. The worst of all words, not sleeping, and not being up and doing stuff.
- Lying in bed awake when I wake up before 5. Sometimes I wake up and can't fall back asleep @ 3 or 4 (which isn't crazy cuz sometimes I go to bed @ 7 or 8). Similar to hitting snooze, I'm not sleeping, and I'm not accomplishing anything.

## Family

### Husband

### Father

## Triggers and Mental Quick Sand

Like most folks I have triggers and mental quick sand which I can get trapped in. Here's some of mine, and things I need to remember. This also reminds me of the [voices in my head](/voices)

### Stress and [anxiety](/anxiety)

### Corona Virus

- My gosh this is sucking up lots of brain power. I don't think I get value thinking about htis. I have two choices, stop thinking about this,_OR_ write a post on all my thoughts on this.

### Raising kids

#### [Physical health](/physical-health)

#### Not spending enough time with them

#### [Diet and Weight](/diet)

### [Financial Security](/money)

#### The point of [money](/money)

Money isn;t just to make piles, it's to enable you to do stuff. Stuff does not equal stuff you don't use, stuff is actually often experiences. And most of the best stuff you can't buy. Yup, it's doing and it's with whom you are doing it.

#### What would I do for less money

If you wouldn't take a job for a pay cut, you probably shouldn't take the job.

#### Making more vs spending more

See [Parkinson's law](/parkinson), applies to both tim and Money.
