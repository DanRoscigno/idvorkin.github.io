It's mid winter break and I've got a week off. I learned I should pre-write these, but I decided (imlicitly, by not applying discipline) to skip it, so I'm starting this at the end of the vacation. This time-off was packed, Stanley Park with Amelia, Yellow Deli with Zach, and a crazy hotel on the Peninsula with Tori. On top of that restarting magic, balloons, and kettlebells and meditation in between.

Context:

- Work has been going great, and I need 1 hours to "disconnect from work". I'm actually excited to get back to work and dig into stuff, but I wrote it in a document and will pick it up when I'm back at work.
- Money Troubles have been great - stock market is through the roof, with Meta and MSFTat all time highs!
- Health has been great (see below)

My top priorities:

- Don't waste it by doing nothing.
- Recharge my "dealer of smiles and wonder" identity - doing balloons and magic.
- Create moments with the family (and take Selfies of them)
- Stay healthy (though this is easier then usual see below)

## Moments

- Zach to Yellow Deli
  - 6 hours with Zach talking about lots of blog content
- Zach to musical improv, then subway to Rosevault
- Tori and I went on a mini-vacation (WOW!)
- Amelia and I did a 2 day trip to Vancouver (Stanley park, Denman street, and Grandville island )

## Success Stories

- Did magic several times:
- Did balloons (FIRST TIME IN MONTHS):
  - Kid at restaurant, kept htinking I should go to the car and get balloon stuff, finally did it after dinner. Of course kid loved it.
- Lots of physical exercise:
  - Every time in Seattle hit the gym, and got great workouts

## Top Learnings

_This is less new learnings, and more refcounts to existing knowledge_

- It really is easier to divide and conquer the family
- Going to Vancouver when [Toni](/tesla) is driving is trivial
- The messed up spoon story with Amelia :(
- Tori and Amelia prefer a plan in advance (this isn't much of a learning)
- I've gotten way better at travel thanks to all my MPK trips (I used to fret about packing for days, now i just have everything in my travel bag, and the car is packed with stuff)
- Have all the stuff I want pre-loaded ( like balloon gear)
- My discipline:
  - I don't think of my self as being disicplined, but then people tell me you're crazy, ypou're super disciplined
    - I wake up at 4:30 and gym
    - I gym like 6 days a week for 1-2 horus
    - I meditate
    - I write a tonne
    - I went years losing 5 lbs a motnh
  - I think what it is is I"m hyper disciplined, but ...
    - I'm not realistic on how mcuh I can do, so 20 habits i want, can only do 5, so some are always rotatin gin and out, not congruent with my deliberate desires
    - I get mentla blocks, like can't cash checks on the fridge For years
    - Can't refill hottub so haven' tused it (which I love) for a year.
