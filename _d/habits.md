Habits are the automatic actions, both positive and negative, you take through your life. Atomic Habits describes how to change habits, it's the how-to manual for "Sharpening the Saw".

### Big Ideas;

#### Systems more important then goals

Goals are point in time, systems are like the drip, drip, drip of daily improvement.
Hi reps, low weight.
Habit stacking
Systems drive input KPIs.
Output KPIs lag input KPIs.
A easy way to say this is "Compensation lags competance"

#### Habits in context

Your identity re-inforces your habits, which intern creates your outcomes.

- Identity
- Habits
- Outcome

### Habit model

Lets go back to that other idea: How a habit is formed.

Cue, Craving, Response, Reward.

Positive:

Cue: Make obvious (Hey look)
Craving: Make it attractive (I want tot do it)
Response: Make it easy (remove all friction)
Reward: Make it satisfying (feel good one done - savor it)

Negative:

Cue: Make it invisible (Stay out of the trap)
Craving: Make it painful (I know I feel bad doing)
Response: Make it painful (make it painful to do)
Reward: Make it unhappy (be unsatisfied, but still be gentle and don’t ruin your identity. Isn’t that curious)

Examples - Negative

Cue: Get my coffee
Craving: Sit in my chair
Response: Feels Nice
Reward: Rested.

### Habit Stacking

I think when it comes to compound interest, there is no better positive example for me then my command-line foo. I can truly do everything, on all computers, with almost no effort. As soon as a stronger tool comes a long I’m ready to consume it. Now, also because it’s not just the tool, but the thing I do with the tool I’m ready to go.
