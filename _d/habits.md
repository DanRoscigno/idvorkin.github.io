Habits are the automatic actions, both positive and negative, you take through your life. Atomic Habits describes how to change habits, it's the how-to manual for "Sharpening the Saw".

### Big Ideas;

#### Systems more important then goals

Goals are point in time, systems are like the drip, drip, drip of daily improvement.
Hi reps, low weight.
Habit stacking
Systems drive input KPIs.
Output KPIs lag input KPIs.
A easy way to say this is "Compensation lags competence"

#### Habits in context

Your identity re-enforces your habits, which intern creates your outcomes.

- Identity
- Habits
- Outcome

### Habit model

Lets go back to that other idea: How a habit is formed.

| State    | Description                      | Negative          | Positive                            |
| -------- | -------------------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Cue      | Thing that kicks off the thought | Hang with friends | Sit on Mediation Bench              |
| Craving  | The desired state                | Relaxed Buzz      | Calm mind/being a meditator         |
| Response | The action, aka habit            | Drinking the beer | Meditating                          |
| Reward   | Achieving the desired state      | Being Buzzed      | Being Calm/Feeling like a meditator |

Another habit I have is playing on the command line (both writing and updating my shell)

| State    | Actions                                 |
| -------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Cue      | Opening blink                           |
| Craving  | Be a command line guru/writer           |
| Response | Playing with command line/blog          |
| Reward   | Feeling like a command line guru/writer |

### Changing habits

| State    | Adding                      | Removing             |
| -------- | --------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Cue      | Make it obvious and visible | Make it invisible    |
| Craving  | Make it attractive          | Make it displeasing  |
| Response | Make it easy                | Make it hard         |
| Reward   | Make it satisfying          | Make it unsatisfying |

### Creating new Cues

You need to make the cue obvious, and there are two ways:

1. Set a date and time intention
1. Tie it to another habit.
