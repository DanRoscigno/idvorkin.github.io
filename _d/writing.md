## Why

### Amazon's Writing Culture

My favorite thing about [Amazon](/amazon) was the ethos of the writing culture. You've probably heard the story, during meetings. Every meeting starts with 30 minutes of silent reading followed by discussion.

On my second day at [Amazon](/amazon) I had my first meeting. After we went around the room introducing the new guy (me), a stapled 6 page printout was handed out and silence descended on the room. I went throught the document in 5 minutes. I didn't understand much of it, after all I was new and didn't know what these guys worked on. I then had to sit in silence fidgetting for the next 25 minutes. At the 30 minute mark, people started discussion. "I understand your reasoning, but did you consider the new market trends?", "How do you imagine things will change if we don't complete this within a month?" I was really surprised. I didn't notice any of these things in the document. How did these folks get this deep understanding of the document? They must have had a deep knowledge of the domain I thought. Nope.

Turns out, to build a clear writing muscle, you must build a critical thinking muscle, which requires a critical reading muscle. After 3 years at Amazon, my skills had increased drastically, but I was still weak at these by Amazon standards.
