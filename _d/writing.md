Useful writing tells people something true and important that they didn't already know in a way that leaves no doubt. Most writing is bad. Not due to spelling, punctuation or grammer, but due to lack of critical thinking. Critical thinking like analysis, synthesis, simplification, and presentation.

## Why

### Amazon's Writing Culture

{%include blob_image_float_right.html src="noun_writing.svg?sanitize=1" %}

My favorite thing about [Amazon](/amazon) was the ethos of the writing culture. You've probably heard the story, during meetings. Every meeting starts with 30 minutes of silent reading followed by discussion.

On my second day at [Amazon](/amazon) I had my first meeting. After we went around the room introducing the new guy (me), a stapled 6 page printout was handed out and silence descended on the room. I went throught the document in 5 minutes. I didn't understand much of it, after all I was new and didn't know what these guys worked on. I then had to sit in silence fidgetting for the next 25 minutes. At the 30 minute mark, people started discussion. "I understand your reasoning, but did you consider the new market trends?", "How do you imagine things will change if we don't complete this within a month?" I was really surprised. I didn't notice any of these things in the document. How did these folks get this deep understanding of the document? They must have had a deep knowledge of the domain I thought. Nope.

Turns out, to build a clear writing muscle, you must build a critical thinking muscle, which requires a critical reading muscle. After 3 years at Amazon, my skills had increased drastically, but I was still weak at these by Amazon standards.

### Sucking till you don't

You're going to suck till you don't. I could never explain it as well as Ira Glass (the host of this america life), so watch his video:

### Building Knowledge - Evergreen notes

[Evergreen notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4SDCZQeRo4xFEQ8H4qrSqd68ucpgE6LU155C), are a concept brilliantly articulated by Andy Matuschak. Worth a read in its entirety, but I'll inline his definiton:

Evergreen notes are written and organized to evolve, contribute, and accumulate over time, across projects. This is an unusual way to think about writing notes: Most people take only transient notes. That’s because these practices aren’t about writing notes; they’re about effectively developing insight: “Better note-taking” misses the point; what matters is “better thinking”. When done well, these notes can be quite valuable: Evergreen note-writing as fundamental unit of knowledge work.

It’s hard to write notes that are worth developing over time. These principles help.

Evergreen notes should be:

- atomic
- concept-oriented
- densely linked
- interlinked (like the web), as opposed to hierarchal (like file folders).

You'll note, this blog is my implementaiton of evergreen notes.

## Analysis tools

### SWOT and SOAR - Exploring the space

SWOT:

| Axis         | Tailwinds   | Headwinds |
| ------------ | ----------- | --------- |
| **Internal** | Strength    | Weakeness |
| **External** | Opportunity | Threats   |

SOAR:

| Axis         | Value Proposition | Goal        |
| ------------ | ----------------- | ----------- |
| **Today**    | Strength          | Opportunity |
| **Tomorrow** | Aspiration        | Results     |

### MECE - How you know you're done.

Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhausted (MECE), is two distint ideas.

“Mutually exclusive” is a concept from probability theory that says two events cannot occur at the same time. For example, if you roll a six-sided die, the outcomes of a six or a three are mutually exclusive. When applied to information, mutually exclusive ideas would be distinctly separate and not overlapping.

“Collectively exhaustive” means that the set of ideas is inclusive of all possible options. Going back to the six-sided dice example, the set {1,2,3,4,5,6} is mutually exclusive AND collectively exhaustive.

### Minto's Pyramid Principle

A [rare book](https://www.amazon.com/Pyramid-Principle-Logic-Writing-Thinking/dp/0273710516/) on how to write well. Sadly long out of print, but worth picking up a copy

{%include amazon.html asin="0273710516;" %}

## Writing Formulas

### The detective formula: Situation, Complication, Resolution

### The Hero's Journey Formula:

### The feedback formula: Situation, Behavior, Impact

### The crappy modern business book

The modern business/self-help book formula is: XYZ, and it's crappy.

A modern well written business book is the [first 90 days](/90days). Highly recommended.

## Pen to paper

### Madman, Architect, Carpenter, Judge

From [my full post](https://ig2600.blogspot.com/2015/07/soft-skills-writing-as-madman-architect.html)
Writing breaks down into 4 distinct phases: brainstorming, organization, writing and editing. To reinforce the distinctness of these phases, think of writing as four distinct jobs: Madman, Architect, Carpenter and Judge. Maximize your efficiency by doing each job, distinctly, deliberately and serially.

Each job has a specific goal, and that goal should be your sole focus during while doing that job. Do not do the next job, and do not go back to previous jobs. To reinforce the distinctness of each job, consider using a different tool, and physical reminders of each job.

### On essay's and writing:

Paul Graham

http://www.paulgraham.com/useful.html

_I've never tried to count how many times I proofread essays, but I'm sure there are sentences I've read 100 times before publishing them. When I proofread an essay, there are usually passages that stick out in an annoying way, sometimes because they're clumsily written, and sometimes because I'm not sure they're true. The annoyance starts out unconscious, but after the tenth reading or so I'm saying "Ugh, that part" each time I hit it. They become like briars that catch your sleeve as you walk past. Usually I won't publish an essay till they're all gone — till I can read through the whole thing without the feeling of anything catching._

### Writers head to readers head, like an army through a choke point

### My 80 hours on an outage document

When something goes wrong at amazon you write a [correction of errors(COE)](/coe) document. In my last few months of Amazon I wrote a COE on an Alexa outage which was a result of poor interaction between the system that turns "speech into text"(ASR) and the system that turns "text into meaning" (NLU).

This was some deeply technical stuff, but needed to be clear so non-domain experts could understand what happened. I ended up spending over 80 hours on this, and even enlisted the help of a marketing person who had no idea how Alexa worked to ensure my writing was crystal clear.

Some people might be appled. 80 hours is 2 strait weeks of work, (which I stretched out over 4 weeks). I think it was time well spent for two reasons.

First, I was muscle building. I'm pretty sure if my writing muscle was fully matured, and I had already understood the ASR and NLU space, I could have written this document in 20 hours, meaning 60 hours was just training, which is always worth it.

Second, outage is expensive, as is incorrect action,
