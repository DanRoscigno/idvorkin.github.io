## Why

### Amazon's Writing Culture

{%include blob_image_float_right.html src="noun_writing.svg?sanitize=1" %}

My favorite thing about [Amazon](/amazon) was the ethos of the writing culture. You've probably heard the story, during meetings. Every meeting starts with 30 minutes of silent reading followed by discussion.

On my second day at [Amazon](/amazon) I had my first meeting. After we went around the room introducing the new guy (me), a stapled 6 page printout was handed out and silence descended on the room. I went throught the document in 5 minutes. I didn't understand much of it, after all I was new and didn't know what these guys worked on. I then had to sit in silence fidgetting for the next 25 minutes. At the 30 minute mark, people started discussion. "I understand your reasoning, but did you consider the new market trends?", "How do you imagine things will change if we don't complete this within a month?" I was really surprised. I didn't notice any of these things in the document. How did these folks get this deep understanding of the document? They must have had a deep knowledge of the domain I thought. Nope.

Turns out, to build a clear writing muscle, you must build a critical thinking muscle, which requires a critical reading muscle. After 3 years at Amazon, my skills had increased drastically, but I was still weak at these by Amazon standards.

## How

### Madman, Architect, Carpenter, Judge

From [my full post](https://ig2600.blogspot.com/2015/07/soft-skills-writing-as-madman-architect.html)
Writing breaks down into 4 distinct phases: brainstorming, organization, writing and editing. To reinforce the distinctness of these phases, think of writing as four distinct jobs: Madman, Architect, Carpenter and Judge. Maximize your efficiency by doing each job, distinctly, deliberately and serially.

Each job has a specific goal, and that goal should be your sole focus during while doing that job. Do not do the next job, and do not go back to previous jobs. To reinforce the distinctness of each job, consider using a different tool, and physical reminders of each job.

### Evergreen notes (aka this blog)

[Evergreen notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4SDCZQeRo4xFEQ8H4qrSqd68ucpgE6LU155C), are a concept brilliantly articulated by Andy Matuschak. Worth a read in its entirety, but I'll inline his definiton:

Evergreen notes are written and organized to evolve, contribute, and accumulate over time, across projects. This is an unusual way to think about writing notes: Most people take only transient notes. That’s because these practices aren’t about writing notes; they’re about effectively developing insight: “Better note-taking” misses the point; what matters is “better thinking”. When done well, these notes can be quite valuable: Evergreen note-writing as fundamental unit of knowledge work.

It’s hard to write notes that are worth developing over time. These principles help.

Evergreen notes should be:

- atomic
- concept-oriented
- densely linked
- interlinked (like the web), as opposed to hierarchal (like file folders).

### Minto's Pyramid Principle

A [rare book](https://www.amazon.com/Pyramid-Principle-Logic-Writing-Thinking/dp/0273710516/) on how to write well. Sadly long out of print, but worth picking up a copy

### Sucking till you don't

You're going to suck till you don't. I could never explain it as well as Ira Glass (the host of this america life), so watch his video:

### A great story

Doesn't really fit, but I do enjoy this story

### The crappyness of the modern business books

The modern business/self-help book formula is: XYZ, and it's crappy.

A modern well written business book is the [first 90 days](/90days). Highly recommended.
