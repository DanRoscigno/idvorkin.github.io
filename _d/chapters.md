Our lives are stories, containing many different chapters. However, regardless of what is in the chapters, we all go through life stages, being young, growing up, getting old, etc. What you need as a 22 year old, and what you need as a 42 year old sure are different. I think our lives are both chapters in terms of the plot, but also in terms of ap

## The western model

### 20s - Try everything you can

And my advice to folks in their 20s - [Which I gave as a talk for the Amazon Interns](/22)

{% include youtube.html src="ffU-Z44Yc6c" %}

### 30s - Avoid what you don't like

I'm workign on this talk, give me content!

### 40s - Focus on what you do like

- This is your peak earnings, and peak productivity. You've got maximum experience and minimal mental decline.
- Your body is no longer foregiving of incorrect movements, and healing is much harder.
- The health debt you likely took on in your 30s need to be paid back otherwise you'll degrade quickly.
- As you get older, you will decline, the work you do in your 40s will be the starting point for your decline, and simultainously impact your rate of decline.

### 50s - Don't know yet

### 60s - Don't know yet

## What I wish I knew when my kids

Read the [prophet on children](https://www.amazon.com//dp/0394404289/):

_Your children are not your children.
They are the sons and daughters of Life’s longing for itself.
They come through you but not from you,
And though they are with you yet they belong not to you._

_You may give them your love but not your thoughts,
For they have their own thoughts._

_You may house their bodies but not their souls,
For their souls dwell in the house of tomorrow, which you cannot visit, not even in your dreams._

_You may strive to be like them, but seek not to make them like you.
For life goes not backward nor tarries with yesterday._

_You are the bows from which your children as living arrows are sent forth._

_The archer sees the mark upon the path of the infinite, and He bends you with His might that His arrows may go swift and far._

_Let your bending in the archer’s hand be for gladness;
For even as He loves the arrow that flies, so He loves also the bow that is stable._

### were new

- Take a chill pill
- The days are long but the years fly by
- This is what it's all about

### were two

- To you, your kids will be dismmisive and disrepectful. To see your influence, go watch them describe you to their friends. You'll often be on a pedestal.
- Do don't tell. They can tell when you do stuff.

### were teens

- They are human, your best best is treat them like adults.

### were adults
