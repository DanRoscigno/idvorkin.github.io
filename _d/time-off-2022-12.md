title: Time off X-mas 2022
---

It's X-mas 2022, quite the fall excitement edition! and 've got 1 and change  weeks off in an attempt to maximize my personal development and satisfaction during my time off, by staying balanced, and minimizing my vegetation I'm going to pre-write what I want to get done, and adjust it as I go.

This is a combination of [time off](/time-off), and all the stuff for [happiness](/happy), which I guess gets tangled up with half of my evergreen notes.

Humoursly, I can just copy much of my todo from last year as it's pretty simmilar!

## My top priorities:

### Health and Habits

My habits and balance have been strong, just keep my streaks running!

- End the year at and honest 180 (even better a lying 175)
- Keep up the daily gym, magic and ballooning

- Create moments with the family (and take Selfies of them)

## Moments

- Amelia's Holiday Party (Deaf kid, coming back seeing everyone)
- TBD Jumped in the lake 2021

From last year ...


**Spending vacation days when it's "fun time at work"** Not a problem at all this year.

**January is going to be a tough month at work.** January is calibration time at Meta. The team is a fair bit smaller then last year so I'm feeling good about this.
