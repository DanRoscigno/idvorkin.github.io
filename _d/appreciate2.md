Think of the last time you were appreciated: How did you feel? Think about the last hour: How many things could you have appreciated? It takes 7 positive experiences to make up for 1 negative experience - what can you be appreciating?

Here's my thinking on appreciation.

### Won't appreciating people let people get a way with less then they can accomplish
