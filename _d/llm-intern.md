LLMs are new, and we need to work them differently. A model I'm thinking through is LLMs as interns

## A New Computational Model - Interns

### The Perfect Intern

- Super smart
- Super creative
- But makes mistakes
- So you need to coach

### Your Intern Can't Read Your Mind - Prompting

- Input is conversational.
- When instructing our intern, we assume we have sufficiently specified what we want.
- But very quickly realize you haven't.
- See prompt engineering.

## Intern Quirks and Mitigations

- Non-deterministic: Every call you get a different intern.
- Sometimes it'll just be a bad intern, can lie, or ignore instructions.
- TODO: Link to build '23 talk by OpenAI scientist.
- Sometimes you get a dud and they ignore the instructions. :(
- The longer the answer, the more they can think; short answers have them thinking less.
- Once committed to an answer, even if wrong, they'll keep going.

## Use cases: What should we hire the intern to do?

### The Perfect Sandals - Remember the user problem

### Relationships

### Summarize

### Express myself

## LLM Programs - Code and Mind Reading

Conventional Programming vs Delegating to an Intern

### The Before Times - It's All Code (Code)

### The Perfect Program - It Just Reads Your Mind (Prompts)

### Maybe Reading Your Mind Is Too Hard - Input Affordances

### Give Me Choices - Output Affordances

### Balancing Code and Prompts

## Appendix

### LLM-Book
