LLMs and GenAI is new. A great way to build models for new things is with analogies to old things. In this case the old thing is interns!

## A New Computational Model - Interns

ASIDE: No interns were harmed in the creation of this talk. I love interns, and have been one myself. I'm just using them as a metaphor for LLMs.

### The Perfect Intern

- Super smart
- Super creative
- But makes mistakes
- So you need to coach

### Your Intern Can't Read Your Mind - Prompting

- Input is conversational.
- When instructing our intern, we assume we have sufficiently specified what we want.
- But very quickly realize you haven't.
- Very hard to evaluate if your intern did good
- See prompt engineering.

### Bad Itern - Intern Quirks and Mitigations

- Non-deterministic: Every call you get a different intern.
- Sometimes it'll just be a bad intern, can lie, or ignore instructions.
- TODO: Link to build '23 talk by OpenAI scientist.
- Sometimes you get a dud and they ignore the instructions. :(
- The longer the answer, the more they can think; short answers have them thinking less.
- Once committed to an answer, even if wrong, they'll keep going.
- Very dangerous, since so used to smart, honest interns, when you get a bad intern that's confident, it can really throw you for a loop.

### What are you thinking - Understandability

### Brain Surgery - Do I need to understand paramater count and neural networks

- No more then you need to understand dopamine or synapses.

## Use cases: What should we hire the intern to do?

### The Perfect Sandals - Remember the user problem

### Relationships

### Summarize

### Express myself

## LLM Programs - Code and Mind Reading

Conventional Programming vs Delegating to an Intern

### LLM as Computer

- LLM is the CPU
- You need to write the program for the LLM, thatâ€™s the prompt
- Big problem is the context window, or RAM.
- Your job is the efficiently use the RAM, you can store anything you want in the hard drive. You need to figure out how to go from hard drive data to RAM

### The Before Times - It's All Code (Code)

### The Perfect Program - It Just Reads Your Mind (Prompts)

### Maybe Reading Your Mind Is Too Hard - Input Affordances

### Give Me Choices - Output Affordances

### Balancing Code and Prompts

### Bad Intern -

## Appendix

### LLM-Book

Very deeply inspired by: <https://vladris.com/llm-book/>

### Talk to the intern

- Ha, make a chat bot from this post ... pending
