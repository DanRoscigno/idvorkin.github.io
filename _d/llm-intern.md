LLMs are new, and we need to work them differently. A model I'm thinking through is LLMs as interns

## A new computational model

### The Perfect intern

- Super smart
- Super creative
- But makes mistakes
- So you need to coach

### Your intern can't read your mind - prompting

- Input is conversational.
- When instructing our intern, we assume we have sufficiently specified what we want
- But very quickly realize you haven't
- See prompt engineefring

## Intern quirks and mitigations

- Non deterministic: Every call you get a different intern,
- Sometimes it'll just be a bad intern, can lie, or ignore instructionsf
- TODO: Link to build '23 talk by OpenAI scientist
- Sometimes you get a dud and they ignore the instructions. :(
- The longer the answer, the more they can think, short answer have them thinking less
- Once committed to an answer, even if wrong, they'll keep goingf

## LLM programs - Code and Mind Reading

Conventional Programming vs delegating to an intern

### The before times - it's all code (code)

### The perfect program - it just reads your mind (prompts)

### Maybe reading your mind is too hard - Input affordances

### Give me choices - Output affordances

### Balancing code and prompts
