### Motivation

**1.** **Begin with the end in mind:** Decide exactly what you want and why. Clarity is [essential](/essential). Write out your goals and objectives before you begin.

**7.** **Focus on key result areas:** Identify those results that you absolutely, positively have to get to do your job well, and work on them all day long.

**8.** **Apply the Law of Three:** Identify the three things you do in your work that account for 90 percent of your contribution, and focus on getting them done before anything else. You will then have more time for your family and personal life.

**4.** **Consider the consequences:** Your most important tasks and priorities are those that can have the most serious consequences, positive or negative, on your life or work. Focus on these above all else.

### Planning the project

**12.** **Identify your key constraints:** Determine the bottlenecks or choke points, internal or external, that set the speed at which you achieve your most important goals, and focus on alleviating them.

**3.** **Apply the 80/20 Rule to everything:** Twenty percent of your activities will account for 80 percent of your results. Always concentrate your efforts on that top 20 percent.

**6.** **Use the urgent/import matrix, and ABCDE framework continually:** Before you begin work on a list of tasks, take a few moments to organize them by value and priority so you can be sure of working on your most important activities. Items should be done in alphabetical order.

### Execution

**2.** **Plan every day in advance:** Think on paper. Every minute you spend in planning can save you five or ten minutes in execution.

**5.** **Practice creative procrastination:** Since you can’t do everything, you must learn to deliberately put off those tasks that are of low value so that you have enough time to do the few things that really count.

**9.** **Prepare thoroughly before you begin:** Have everything you need at hand before you start. Assemble all the papers, information, tools, work materials, and numbers you might require so that you can get started and keep going.

**10.** **Take it one oil barrel at a time:** You can accomplish the biggest and most complicated job if you just complete it one step at a time.

**11.** **Sharpen the saw** The more knowledgeable and skilled you become at your key tasks, the faster you start them and the sooner you get them done. Determine exactly what it is that you are very good at doing, or could be very good at, and throw your whole heart into doing those specific things very, very well.

**13.** **Put the pressure on yourself:** Imagine that you have to leave town for a month, and work as if you had to get your major task completed before you left.

**14.** **Motivate yourself into action:** Be your own cheerleader. Look for the good in every situation. Focus on the solution rather than the problem. Always be optimistic and constructive.

**15.** **Technology is a terrible master:** Take back your time from enslaving technological addictions. Learn to often turn devices off and leave them off.

**16.** **Technology is a wonderful servant:** Use your technological tools to confront yourself with what is most important and protect yourself from what is least important.

**17.** **Focus your attention:** Stop the interruptions and distractions that interfere with completing your most important tasks.

**18.** **Slice and dice the task**: Break large, complex tasks down into bite-sized pieces, and then do just one small part of the task to get started.

**19.** **Create large chunks of time:** Organize your days around large blocks of time so you can concentrate for extended periods on your most important tasks.

**20.** **Develop a sense of urgency:** Make a habit of moving fast on your key tasks. Become known as a person who does things quickly and well.

**21.** **Single handle every task:** Set clear priorities, start immediately on your most important task, and then work without stopping until the job is 100 percent complete. This is the real key to high performance and maximum personal productivity.

### ABCDE and Important Not Urgent

I need to process how to merge the important and not urgent matrix with the ABCDE prioritization matix

“A” items are important and urgent **I/U**, something that you must do. This is a task that will have serious consequences (positive or negative), finishing a calibration packets for upcoming calibration or dealing with a root canal. If you have more than one A task, prioritize, and execute in order “A-1,” “A-2,” “A-3,” Your A-1 task is your biggest, ugliest frog of all. Start there.

**TBD: Where to work in Important and Not-Urgent**
**TBD: Where to work in Positive Habits and Practices**

“B” items are urgent and not important **U/NI** - something you should do. But it has only mild consequences. These are the tadpoles of your work life. This means that someone may be unhappy or inconvenienced if you don’t do one of these tasks, but it is nowhere as important as an A task. Returning an unimportant telephone message or reviewing your e-mail would be a B task.

A “C” task is defined as something that would be _nice_ to do but for which there are no consequences at all, whether you do it or not. C tasks include phoning a friend, having coffee or lunch with a coworker, and completing some personal business during work hours. These sorts of activities have no effect at all on your work life.

A “D” task is defined as something you can _delegate_ to someone else. The rule is that you should delegate everything that someone else can do so you can free up more time for the A tasks that only you can do.

“E” task are not important/not urgent **NI/NU** is defined as something that you can _eliminate_ altogether, and it won’t make any real difference. This may be a task that was important at one time but is no longer relevant to you or anyone else. Often it is something you continue to do out of habit or because you enjoy it. But every minute that you spend on an E task is time taken away from an A task or activity that can make a real difference in your life.
