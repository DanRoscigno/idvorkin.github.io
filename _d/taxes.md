Most of the tax information on the web is a mess, and confusing. Heres my most common tax questions and answers.

Assumptions: You're in the same boat as me. Just a normal family with high income, no second house, or goofy things.

### Should I hold my high risk/high return investments in my taxable or non-taxable accounts?

### My high risk investments are already in non-taxable, should I sell them and swap them with my taxable account?

### Marginal vs Average Tax Rate

Taxes are like a step function. From 0 - K1 you pay rate t1, From K1 - K2 you pay rate t2, etc. The marginal tax rate is how much tax you pay on every extra dollar make, E.g. the tax rate in the maximum step. By contrast, your average tax rate is the total taxes/total income, which can be significantly less then the marginal tax rate depending on how far over the step function you are.

### Short vs Long term Capital gains

### Back Door Roths and Pro Rata Penalty

### 529s

### Do I want a roth or a normal IRA (401K)

### Should I make a back door roth

### No load funds
