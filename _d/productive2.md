## Concepts

### Focus on energy, not on time

We say I didn't have time, but usually, the limiting factor isn't time, it's energy.

That's good because time is finite, and monotnically decreasing. Energy, by contrast, is dynamic. Activities and experiences can create and destroy energy.

What's amazing to me is how going to the gym can be energy positive.
