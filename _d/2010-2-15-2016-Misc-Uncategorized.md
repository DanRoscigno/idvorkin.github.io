- From Cognative Control to Curiosity.

### Knowledge vs Wisdom

- Knowledge - The rider knows it.

### Curiosity

- Feels good
- Self Awareness, focus on 'how curious' instead of congnative

### Cognitive vs Curiosity based improvement.

- Reframe
- Cognative Control (rider) is hard, BUT curiosity is much easier.
- Curiosity does not take discipline, just awareness.
- From Curiosity, can make progress.

### Love and rejection.

- Afraid to love because fear of rejection
- Very common statement, in the grand, but happens in the small too.
- Someone needed a charger, I could give it to them, but i didn't.
- Why? fear of rejection.
- Win/Win
  - I offer/needed - Someone feels loved, and I feel great - WIN!
  - I offer/not needed/Appreciate - Someone feels loved, I feel great - WIN!
  - I offer/not needed/grumpy - Someone feels angry, I feel sad - LOSS! (how often?)
