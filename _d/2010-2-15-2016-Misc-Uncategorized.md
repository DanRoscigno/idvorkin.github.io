There are lots of rough ideas I have that are not yet categorized, or good enough to be a thought. This will be a
place to store them.

### Magic: Great example of Seth Godin principles

      * Choosing myself, hard work,  building trust, and deserving attention.
      * NOT: Building a tribe, because there is no scale out/distribution.
      * Challenge Expectation - Do magic on bus, when people are expecting to stare off into space.
      * Connection
           * Signed card
           * Do you know a magic word?
           * Signed card ambitious card
           * In hands card routine.
      * Q: How do I build MORE connection to audience.

### Class Act:

    * NEVER speak badly of anyone
    * Only say what you'd say to their face.
    * Take full responsiblity
    * Give all credit to others.

### Igor's UVP:

    * Mantra: People cry when I move on.
    * Ideas Executed Brilliantly.
    * Growing teams

### Igor's Key Activites:

        * Intermittent Fasting

### Quotes:

    * Half the pressure, twice the speed - do it without stress/pressure, but do it quickly.

### Grandmother mind

    * From Cognative Control to Curiosity.

### Knowledge vs Wisdom

    * Knowledge - The rider knows it.
    * Wisdom - The elphent knows it.
    * How to train the elphant? Curiosity

### Curiosity

    * Feels good
    * Self Awareness, focus on 'how curious' instead of congnative
    * How curious, is less judgmental

### Cognative vs Curiosity based improvement.

    * Reframe
    * Cognative Control (rider) is hard, BUT curiosity is much easier.
    * Curiosity does not take discipline, just awareness.
    * From Curiosity, can make progress.

### Love and rejection.

    * Afraid to love because fear of rejection
    * Very common statement, in the grand, but happens in the small too.
    * Someone needed a charger, I could give it to them, but iddn't.
    * Why? fear of rejection.
    * Win/Win
        * I offer/needed - Someone feels loved, and I feel great - WIN!
        * I offer/not needed/Appreciate - Someone feels loved, I feel great - WIN!
        * I offer/not needed/grumpy - Someone feels angry, I feel sad - LOSS! (how often?)

_suprise: these are my dail affirmations_

- Deliberate, Disciplined, Daily
- Essentialism (I choose to do the most important thing)
- Appreciate
- First Understand, then be understated
- Provide Context

Focusing on quality of life

- Climbing the steps again and again at work
- Getting the gym that was closest to work
- Optimize for the most enjoyable commute (not necassarily the shortest)

Blog posts for this week?

- Carrying my own cultural bubble (atmosphere)
- Chop chop vs people first
  - Efficiency is the wrong metric for people first.
- Count books is the wrong metric for libraries
  - Right metric is customer engagement

_Some of these are extra valuable depending on your teams culture_

- Relationships first (vs efficiency)
