Waiting in line at the grocery store, sitting in an Uber, pooping - in these invisible times, we execute our idle loop. We spend a lot of time in our idle loop, and it can either increase our energy or drain it. By being aware of and then modifiying how we spend our idle loop we can improve our lives one poop at a time.
