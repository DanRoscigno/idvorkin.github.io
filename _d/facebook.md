## The Good

### Bootcamp

Fantastic idea, 4-6 weeks dedicated to learning about Facebook. Managers also go through bootcamp and code - fantastic! Very high quality videos.
A major part of bootcamp is doing tasks, which is hands on learning, and a great introduction to teams.

NOTE: I did bootcamp through Pandemic 1 so my experience might be a bit different.

NOTE: At all companies I've worked at a strong correlation to engineer success is days till first checkin. For sure there's some correlation not causation here, BUT at FB, all boot campers deploy a 'hello world' to FB on your first few days, and you fix your first production bug in the first week.

### Managers "support" their team.

When I did an informational with FB, the manager asked me how I support my team? I couldn't parse what the question meant. At FB, the primary term they use to describe a manager's role is supporting their team. What a best practice in general, and what a great lens to view management.

### Inclusion and Diversity.

At AMZN, I was in the inclusion bar raiser program, which was in it's infancy, so a huge contrast.

The first lecture I saw at FB started with an explanation of using pro-nouns, and then many folks talking openly about their gender and identity. Super cool, and I loved the talk from the D&I officer.

At the core you want D&I because:

- Being authentic brings your all to the job.
- We need the cognitive diversity to make our product the best.

There is no fairy dust, this will be hard. Follow these rules.

1. Assume good intent
2. Respect each other in communication.
3. Give people room to grow.

### Un allocated hires

Most companies (AMZN, MSFT) say they hire for the company not the team, at which point they assign you to a team you know nothing about. At FB, most non managers are hired un-allocated, and as part of bootcamp and doing the tasks they discover teams and can pick one. It's more work, but sooo good.

Not managers tend to be pre-allocated because there are far fewer manager positions, and it'd suck to come in as a manager and not find a job you like.

### OKRs

### Metric Driven Culture

### Design Quality

Amazon was good at many things, pretty UX not so much. Facebook is a leader in UX, which excites me.

### Employees First

During [Covid](/covid19), FB wanted to relax it's employees so gave them all a 1K bonus, and guaranteed a rating of exceeded. They also said folks that couldn't WFH, like chefs, would still get paid. That's impressive.

At FB, they have a salad bar, and at the end of the bar, there's a guy who 'tosses' your salad dressing. My friend asked him, hey I can toss my own dressing, why are you doing that. He answered - "You can, but FB knows you're special, and wants you to remember it every day, and that's why I'm doing this'.

Wow!!!

<!--
### The Trio: Engineering, Product Management and Data Science

## The peculiar

### Facebook Groups instead of e-mail

Facebook has an enterprise product called Workspace, which is essentially FB. FB uses this instead of e-mail. While odd, it does mean that FB gets better and workplaces get better all at the same time!

### Mono repo.

Peculiar when you come from large companies other then Google.

### Mercurial instead of git

Partially because of the choice of Mono Repo, FB needed to push changes back to community, git didn't want to take them so they pushed them to Mercurial. Sadly, mercurial lost (which is a shame, as I think Mercurial was better).

## The Bad

### I'm new, will add my thoughts as I know them

## Engineering Systems

Oh, so good. Need to figure out what is public and what is private

### Open source lots

Many FB tools get open sourced, tupper ware, mercurial improvements, flow, even data center hardware designs -- what a pleasant contrast to most other places

### Top notch data tools

Some attributes that strike me as great:

1. Very pleasant to use
1. Unified query language across multiple data sources
1. Great IDE (includes VIM, Formating, AutoSave, History, Collaboration, Stats)
1. CLI Support

See a [detailed description of the tools](https://medium.com/analytics-and-data/i-hear-facebook-has-data-does-it-have-data-tools-a9f4c4d82ee7).

### A CLEAR priority

## My projects at Facebook

### Amplifying Connection through Art and tech.

- Augmented Reality in Messenger
- Operational Excellence

### Bonus leanings at Facebook

## Core Values (LP's)

### Focus on Impact

- Motion != Progress
- FB has so much opportunity, prioritization decision should be painful.
- After you pick the focus, you need to say no, no, no.

### Move Fast

Used to be move fast and break stuff, but that's not good at this size. Now it's move fast in your learning.

### Be Bold

- Play to win not 'play to not lose'
- Need to fail once per half, if you're not you're not working hard enough.
- As you get into the half, figure out what goals to dump, and where to double down.n

### Be Open

- Be transport in your work

### Build Social Value

- A platform is 'social value agnostic'
- FB's idea of social value is 'connecting people'
- When you connect people that are mostly similar, they will become more tolerant of each other
- NOTE: When you connect people that are diametrically opposed, they tend to dig in their heals.

## Lingo and Culture

### Show up with grace

### TL;DR
