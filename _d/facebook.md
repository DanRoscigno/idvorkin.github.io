## The Good - Hiring and Onboarding

FB has an exceptionally good and unique hiring and onboarding process.

### Un allocated hires

Many big companies say they hire for the company not the team, at which point they assign you to a team you know almost nothing about. Your chance to learn about the team is usually a few minutes at the end of 5-6 grueling interviews and a 30 minutes "sales pitch" from a hiring manager.

At FB, they really mean you're hired for the company, so you join without picking a team. Then you get 6-10 weeks (bootcamp) to find a team you like. This process includes "sitting" with various teams for a week or so. When sitting with a team you work on a task with the team which lets you see if you like the team, tech and enjoy your time with them. As a result you have a lot more data before signing up to where you'll work for the next few years of your career.

### Bootcamp

Ramping up is hard, so at FB you get 6-10 weeks dedicated to learning about Facebook and picking a team. Managers also go through bootcamp and code, this lets them better understand the FB culture and empathize with the engineers they support. A major part of bootcamp is doing tasks, which is hands on learning, and a way to understand if you like the team you'll be working with.

FB takes bootcamp very seriously, and you're assigned an experienced mentor to guide you through the process, who guides you very closely at the start, and then advises you more generally as you get farther into bootcamp.

As a techie, nothing gives you the confidence like knowing you've shipped, so FB makes it super easy for all boot campers to deploy a 'hello world' to FB on their first few days, and fix their first production bug in the first week. The reason this is possible is FB has fantastic engineering systems, and curates super easy tasks so this is so easy even managers can do it :)

NOTE: I did bootcamp through Pandemic 1 so my experience might be a bit different, and I'm happy to talk through it.

## The Good - Engineering Systems

The best I've ever used. As I learn what is public and private I'll share more details.

### Why they're so good.

I don't know for sure, but I suspect a few things:

- Understanding what a bottleneck engineering time is, and investing resources to make engineers as efficient as possible.
- The company values engineering systems and has several teams whose role is to make things great
- Employees get hack-months to fix stuff they're passionate about
- Employees can choose what they work on, and if an engineer wants to fix the system that annoys them, they do.
- Because it's a single code base (See mono-repo) engineers easily see and can build all the code, so there's a low barrier to entry to fix issues.

### Open source lots

Many FB tools get open sourced, tupper ware, mercurial improvements, flow, even data center hardware designs -- what a pleasant contrast to most other places

### Top notch data tools

Some attributes that strike me as great:

1. Very pleasant to use
1. Unified query language across multiple data sources
1. Great IDE (includes VIM, Formatting, Auto Save, History, Collaboration, Stats)
1. CLI Support

See a [detailed description of the tools](https://medium.com/analytics-and-data/i-hear-facebook-has-data-does-it-have-data-tools-a9f4c4d82ee7).

## The Good

### Not managers, but a person who supports

When I did an informational with FB, the interviewer asked me how I "support my team"? I didn't understand what the question meant. At FB, servant leadership is so ingrained in the culture that when managers introduce themselves, they don't say I'm the manager for "team name", they say I support "team name".

This will be an area I write lots as it's this is some of Facebook's unique value, and I'm exited to internalize it. Some early examples:

### Managers don't tell employees what to work on

Instead, they help employees evaluate what projects they should use. They clarify the needs of the team and larger org, and help employees evaluate which projects are a good fit for their interests, the business, and their growth needs. It is the employees choice though, and regardless of their choice the manager will help the employee be successful.

### Inclusion and Diversity.

At AMZN, I was in the inclusion bar raiser program, which was in it's infancy, so a huge contrast.

The first lecture I saw at FB started with an explanation of using pro-nouns, and then many folks talking openly about their gender and identity. Super cool, and I loved the talk from the D&I officer.

At the core you want D&I because:

- Being authentic brings your all to the job.
- We need the cognitive diversity to make our product the best.

There is no fairy dust, this will be hard. Follow these rules.

1. Assume good intent
2. Respect each other in communication.
3. Give people room to grow.

### OKRs

### Metric Driven Culture

### Design Quality

Amazon was good at many things, pretty UX not so much. Facebook is a leader in UX, which excites me.

### Employees First

During [Covid](/covid19), FB wanted to relax it's employees so gave them all a 1K bonus, and guaranteed a rating of exceeded. They also said folks that couldn't WFH, like chefs, would still get paid. That's impressive.

At FB, they have a salad bar, and at the end of the bar, there's a guy who 'tosses' your salad dressing. My friend asked him, hey I can toss my own dressing, why are you doing that. He answered - "You can, but FB knows you're special, and wants you to remember it every day, and that's why I'm doing this'.

Wow!!!

## The peculiar

### Facebook Groups instead of e-mail

Facebook has an enterprise product called Workspace, which is essentially FB. FB uses this instead of e-mail. While odd, it does mean that FB gets better and workplaces get better all at the same time!

### Monorepo.

Peculiar when you come from large companies other then Google.

### Mercurial instead of git

Partially because of the choice of Mono Repo, FB needed to push changes back to community, git didn't want to take them so they pushed them to Mercurial. Sadly, mercurial lost (which is a shame, as I think Mercurial was better).

### No job title bias

_This probably upgrades to the good section - but definitely peculiar right now coming from AMZN/MSFT_

FB is bottom up, which means they do not believe in positional authority (e.g. you don't get authority due to position high in the org, you get it because people want to listen to you).

To facilitate this FB does not have job titles, (e.g. SDE-I, SDE-II) and levels are confidential information.

Job titles bias you into having a preconceived notion of how much authority you should give the person talking. In a perfect world, you'd grant this authority based on the merit of a person statement's and work, which is what FB optimizes for.

The flip side is going into new situations you need to spend more time evaluating who you should give authority to and how likely someone knows what they are talking about. This is made easier as most work is public and very easy to see. E-mail equivalents (posts), code Reviews, Bug write ups, public thanks, are all completely public, and even show up on a person's feed.

## The Bad - Still learning

_I'm new, will add my thoughts as I know them_

### Anxiety around reviews

Relative to MSFT and AMZN folks are very concerned about reviews. I don't yet know what it's like as a manager, but I think the reason employees are concerned are:

1. Everyone else is concerned about it.
1. It happens twice a year
1. There are [7 rating buckets](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/08/facebook-culture-cult-performance-review-process-blamed.html) though the majority of folks land in 2 buckets.
1. The impact on salary is formulaic and transparent
1. The ratings are relative to other employees (vs absolute) so you can't know which side of the line you are.
1. At the lower levels there's a fixed amount of time you can stay in a level before you get promoted

## My projects at Facebook

### Amplifying Connection through Art and tech.

- Augmented Reality in Messenger
- Operational Excellence

### Bonus leanings at Facebook

## Core Values (LP's)

### Focus on Impact

- Motion != Progress
- FB has so much opportunity, prioritization decision should be painful.
- After you pick the focus, you need to say no, no, no.

### Move Fast

Used to be move fast and break stuff, but that's not good at this size. Now it's move fast in your learning.

### Be Bold

- Play to win not 'play to not lose'
- Need to fail once per half, if you're not you're not working hard enough.
- As you get into the half, figure out what goals to dump, and where to double down.n

### Be Open

- Be transport in your work

### Build Social Value

- A platform is 'social value agnostic'
- FB's idea of social value is 'connecting people'
- When you connect people that are mostly similar, they will become more tolerant of each other
- NOTE: When you connect people that are diametrically opposed, they tend to dig in their heals.

## Lingo and Culture

### Show up with grace

### TL;DR
