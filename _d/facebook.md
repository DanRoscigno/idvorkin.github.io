## The Good

### Bootcamp

Fantastic idea, 4-6 weeks dedicated to learning about Facebook. Managers also go through bootcamp and code - fantastic! Very high quality videos.
A major part of bootcamp is doing tasks, which is hands on learning, and a great introduction to teams.

NOTE: I did bootcamp through Pandemic 1 so my experience might be a bit different.

### Inclusion and Diversity.

At AMZN, I was in the inclusion bar raiser program, which was in it's infancy, so a huge contrast.

The first lecture I saw at FB started with an explanation of using pro-nouns, and then many folks talking openly about their gender and identity. Super cool, and I loved the talk from the D&I officer.

At the core you want D&I because:

- Being authentic brings your all to the job.
- We need the cognitive diversity to make our product the best.

There is no fairy dust, this will be hard. Follow these rules.

1. Assume good intent
2. Respect each other in communication.
3. Give people room to grow.

### Un allocated hires

Most companies (AMZN, MSFT) say they hire for the company not the team, at which point they assign you to a team you know nothing about. At FB, most non managers are hired un-allocated, and as part of bootcamp and doing the tasks they discover teams and can pick one. It's more work, but sooo good.

Not managers tend to be pre-allocated because there are far fewer manager positions, and it'd suck to come in as a manager and not find a job you like.

### OKRs

### Metric Driven Culture

### Design Quality

Amazon was good at many things, pretty UX not so much. Facebook is a leader in UX, which excites me.

### Employees First

During [Covid](/covid19), FB wanted to relax it's employees so gave them all a 1K bonus, and guaranteed a rating of exceeded. They also said folks that couldn't WFH, and thus didn't work would still get paid. That's impressive.

### The Trio: Engineering, Product Management and Data Science

## The Bad

### Looking forward to finding out

## Engineering Systems

Oh, so good. Need to figure out what is public and what is private

## My projects at Facebook

### Amplifying Connection through Art and tech.

- Augmented Reality in Messenger
- Operational Excellence

### Bonus leanings at Facebook

## Core Values (LP's)

### Focus on Impact

- Motion != Progress
- FB has so much opportunity, prioritization decision should be painful.
- After you pick the focus, you need to say no, no, no.

### Move Fast

Used to be move fast and break stuff, but that's not good at this size. Now it's move fast in your learning.

### Be Bold

- Play to win vs Play to not Lose
- Need to fail once per half

### Be Open

- Be transport in your work

### Build Social Value

- A platform is 'social value agnostic'
- FB's idea of social value is 'connecting people'
- When you connect people that are mostly similar, they will become more tolerant of each other
- NOTE: When you connect people that are diametrically opposed, they tend to dig in their heals.
