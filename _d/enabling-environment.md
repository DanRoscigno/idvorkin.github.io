Image a place where you'd do your best work. Andy Matuschak defined this word, and as someone who aspires to effectiveness I fell in love with the concept. As a techie who loves efficiency I set about building my own. From Andy: An enabling environment significantly expands its participantsâ€™ capacity to do things they find meaningful and important. This blog is the consumption environment for mine.

## Igor's Physical Setup

- I think there are some coffee shop rituals that are part of mine.

## By Task

### Production

### Consumption

### Reflection

### Discovery

### Recall

## By Scope

### Individual Atrifacts

### Entire corpus

Check out this thing on embeddigns. I think the story here needs to be embeddgns + rag

## AI Augmentation

What I'm most excited about is how to expand this with AI. My thinking program is my first cut.

Spell check and summary/eli5/TLDR are the obvious ones, but what if we extended to reflection questions, implicit assumptions, etc....

### Critical Thinking

Running over Andy's enabling environment page ...

### Inspiration

Mood matters, and for some reason, illustrating my blog makes me thrilled. IF I'm stuck having DALL-E illustrate my blog makes me thrilled!
