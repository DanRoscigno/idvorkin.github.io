When your emotions aren't serving you well, it's helpful to have a solid protocol. This is the one I especially like.

My notes on anxiety:

## Don't make stuff worse

When anxiety is acute ... the first thing  you need to do is ensure you don't make it worse ... here's how.

## Anxiety Management


### General

Based on [Anxiety Management](https://whatilearnedsofar.com/practice/anxiety-management/)

First, observe you are experiencing anxiety,  and label it - "This feeling I'm experiencing is anxiety".

Emotions, especially pain, are usually automatic and habits, not deliberate or mindful.  Because the emotions are not reliable, we need to assess them before they guide our choices. Recall, many pleasures feel good, but are not good for you (like too much chocolate). And, some pains, which feel bad,  are not bad for you (like anxiety which stops procrastination).

The default way to handle anxiety is avoidance, often through [addiction](/addiction),  which almost always makes it worse. You need to tackle the problem head on.

By teaching ourselves to avoid something we are in fact making the problem worse. The right thing to do is to expose ourselves to the problem, gradually, in duration and frequency. This exposure is the path to resolve the anxiety.

Tackling the problem means you will need to experience the anxiety, you need tools to do so mindfully.

### Approach #1 From potential threat to actual threat

#### Identify the perceieved threat

#### Generate a realistic probability of it happening

#### Examine your level of self-confidence and hope

* Don't be over confident or under confident, be as accurate as you can
* Very easy to be unrealistic on what you can handle or deal with.
* Self doubt increases anxiety
* Getting realistic assessment reduces anxiety

Catching unrealistic self doubts ...

* I can't deal/handle this.

Seeing them consciously is the first step in tackling them

* I don't know what I'll do if ...
* I don't think I can handle it if ...
* I don't think I can face it if ...

Now, look through your past for a counter example. The counter examples may be painful, but are hope you will "survive". This is important and plays to "what doesn't kill you makes you stronger"

If you don't have one in your past, ask it of the human condition - have other people experienced this? Have they gotten through it?


If others can handle this? why do  you think you won't be able to?

If you can't do anything to generate hope, then don't think about the future, distract yourself. Call a friend, workout, watch TV.  Feeling the future is hopeless if that is all you can do, then distract yourself.

### Approach #2 From trying to control to trying to influence.

In general, you have no control, only influence...

The desire to control is black and white. Control is 100% influence, no control is 0% influence. Both of these are illusions. If you're catching yourself using these extremes, you need to re-evaluate. 0% influence is hopelessness and that's certainly false.

To tackle this, apply the following

#### Understand what you are trying to control.

Sometimes you don't think of the thing you're trying to control consciously but it's there. Ask yourself:

- What am I trying to control
- If I had a magic wand and had one wish, what would I change

Often the thing you're trying to control is a link in a chain of deeper issues. The more of these you find the better, each is a point of potential influence! An example about getting sick.


Not the bottom of the chain is often controlling how you want to feel. You can't control how you feel, but you can maximize your influence over it, using meditation and finding hope.


#### Brainstorm how to maximize your influence.

You get hope from


#### Implement your influence

- As you exert your influence, you will feel better
- If you got 1 and 2 correct, then you'll feel better as you influence the situation.
- If you don't feel better, you probably got 1 and 2 wrong, start again.

For the thing everyone wishes to control, their influence over their emotions, meditation is the path. The more you influence your emotions, the better you'll feel.

#### Examine your confidence and hope


### Bonus - some breathing exercises

A box breathing exercise, breath in a pattern - 5,5,10, in, hold, out. Just being able to do this will exert influence, which will help you feel better.
