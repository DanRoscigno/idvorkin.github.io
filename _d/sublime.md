Emotional health is pretty important. Western folks don't have a lot of words to support this; Buddhists have the sublime states: Loving-kindness, Compassion, Altruistic Joy, and Equanimity. Give 'em a try. Most of this is based on "The Joy of Happiness".

- **Loving Thoughts**: Make it a habit to silently wish happiness, safety, and well-being for people you interact with or think about, including strangers you pass on the street. (Happy guy - Pew Pew)
- **Everyday Kindness**: Practice small acts of kindness throughout your day. This could be as simple as offering a smile, giving a sincere compliment, or helping someone in a small way. These actions cultivate a habit of kindness.

<div> </div>
- l21
- **Empathetic Listening**: When talking to someone, especially if they're sharing difficulties, practice fully listening with the intention to understand and empathize, rather than to respond. This fosters a deeper connection and compassion.
- **Acts of Service:** Look for opportunities to alleviate others' suffering through acts of service, whether it's through volunteering, supporting a friend in need, or any gesture that can ease someone's burden.

<div> </div>
- l22
- **Appreciate Others:** Make a conscious effort to celebrate others' successes and joys, no matter how big or small. This can be through congratulatory messages, sharing in their excitement, or simply acknowledging their happiness.
- **Mindful Appreciation:** Notice and appreciate the good in those around you and in your own life. Acknowledging the positive aspects can enhance your capacity for joy.
- When doing something altruistic, think I am being altruistic, this makes me happy
- When seeing someone being altruistic, there exists a wonderful person in the world, I am happy
- When someone is doing an altruistic act, think more good is being done in the world, I am happy

<div> </div>
- l23
- **Balanced Response:** Practice maintaining a calm and balanced response to both positive and negative events. This could mean taking a moment to breathe before reacting, helping to cultivate a more equanimous approach to life's ups and downs.
- **This too shall pass:** Remind yourself of the impermanence of situations, emotions, and life itself. This practice can help cultivate a sense of peace and acceptance, reducing the intensity of attachment and aversion.
