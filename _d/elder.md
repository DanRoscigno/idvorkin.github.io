Midlife has a marketing problem, the next word is always crisis. Chip Conley has lots of good insights here.

### Midlife

  - Adolescence - invented in 1900s before that, just children and adults
  - Sets expectations

  - Includes Support

- Same for midlife

- Old Stage:

  - Work
  - Retire

- Life Stages:

Idea:

1. Evolved elder - not just older, but actively involved in the business environment
2. Learning mindset - curiosity about new technologies and trends
3. Collaborative leadership - guiding, not commanding
4. Counselor - sharing insights and fostering a culture of mutual learning
