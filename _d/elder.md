Midlife has a marketing problem, the next word is always crisis. Chip Conley has lots of good insights here.

Be present ...

- **Noticing**. Modern elders are encouraged to become first-class noticers in order to make the unconscious conscious. You are encouraged to become more fully aware of yourself and others. Noticing (or “awareness”) is a key wisdom skill for making personal changes.
- **Presencing**. Modern elders seek to be really present to others, rather than having a cluttered mind in the presence of others. Doing regular mindfulness meditation calms and quiets the cluttered mind and moves you to be more attentive to others. At the academy, mornings started with group meditation, sitting on an open-air platform facing the Pacific Ocean. Wonderful!

Be proactive ...

- **Mastering**. Modern elders are encouraged to mine their own mastery. “What sage experience do you possess that might help someone a generation or two younger than you? Ideally, your mastery taps into your wisdom and has your fingerprints all over it.”
- **Catalyzing**. Modern elders initiate something new. “How do we best start something? What are the things that have traditionally held us back from new learning, new exploration, and new adventure?”

Have purpose ...

- **Purposing**: Modern elders seek to understand and shape their purpose for living. “Purposing takes time and work. This is often more easily said than done … Being patient as ideas digest and evolve require fortitude to not jump before we are ready.”
- **Editing**. Modern elders are encouraged to use the skill of noticing/awareness for a “great midlife edit.” What could you edit out of your life so that you can edit in something more inspiring and purpose-filled?

Relationships first, Serve Others

- **Connecting**. Modern elders are intentional about connecting with other people, joining in community. “Building rapport, laughing, playing, and socializing form a deep part of human thriving and impact our ability to collaborate. EQ (emotional intelligence) is something that tends to grow with age. Loving well, and feeling well-loved, are the two qualities that people cherish most later in life.”
- **Serving**. Modern elders serve others. Modern elders ask, “How can I best serve this person? … One of the great joys of modern elderhood is the ability to move from attaining — where you seek to be the best you can be — to attuning. In attuning you see yourself as a vehicle to help the world around you become better … through you.”

Idea:

1. Evolved elder - not just older, but actively involved in the business environment
2. Learning mindset - curiosity about new technologies and trends
3. Collaborative leadership - guiding, not commanding
4. Counselor - sharing insights and fostering a culture of mutual learning
