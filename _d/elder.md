### The skills

Being present ...

- **Noticing**. Modern elders are first-class noticers and make the unconscious conscious. They are fully aware of themselves and others.
- **Presencing**. Modern elders are really present for others, rather than having a cluttered mind in the presence of others. Doing regular mindfulness meditation calms and quiets the cluttered mind and moves you to be more attentive to others.

Being proactive ...

- **Mastering**. Modern elders mine their own mastery. “What sage experience do you possess that might help someone a generation or two younger than you? Ideally, your mastery taps into your wisdom and has your fingerprints all over it.”
- **Catalyzing**. Modern elders initiate something new. “How do we best start something? What are the things that have traditionally held us back from new learning, new exploration, and new adventure?”

Having purpose ...

- **Purposing**: Modern elders understand and shape their purpose for living. “Purposing takes time and work. This is often more easily said than done … Being patient as ideas digest and evolve require fortitude to not jump before we are ready.”
- **Editing**. Modern elders use the skill of noticing/awareness for a “great midlife edit.” What could you edit out of your life so that you can edit in something more inspiring and purpose-filled?

Relationships first, Serve Others

_Loving well, and feeling well-loved, are the two qualities that people cherish most later in life.”_

- **Connecting**. Modern elders are intentional about connecting with people, and joining communities. “Building rapport, laughing, playing, and socializing form a deep part of human thriving and impact our ability to collaborate.

- **Serving**. Modern elders serve others. Modern elders ask, “How can I best serve this person? They Move from from attaining — where they seek to win — to attuning - where they seek to understand the environment, be in tune with it, and make it better.
