Of all the places we spend our time, work is the one that dominates. However, when we look back on our lives, work is often the thing we remember least. Why? Because we remember our lives through peak momements, and there are few of those, especially positive peak moments, at work.  Luckily, peak moments can be created and managers can be taught how to create them. This post explores opportunities and techniques to create these moments.

Most managers focus on solving problems, making sure employees and customers aren't frustrated, but managers can do better. They can create peak moments which define our lives. To do this we have 3 strategies: 

1. Create moments of elevation by planning to create the peak moments 
1. Create moments of insight by stretch your employees so they are challenged.
