Of all the places we spend our time, work is the one that dominates. However, when we look back on our lives, work is often the thing we remember least. Why? Because we remember our lives through peak movements, and there are few of those, especially positive peak moments, at work.  Luckily, peak moments can be created and managers can be taught how to create them. This post explores opportunities and techniques to create these moments.

Most managers focus on solving problems, making sure employees and customers aren't frustrated, but this is table stakes and not memorable.  Luckily, managers can do better. They can create peak moments which we'll remember when we look back on our lives. To do this we have 3 strategies: 

1. Create moments of elevation by planning to create the peak moments 
1. Create moments of insight by stretch your employees so they are challenged.
1. Create moments of pride by recognizing employees at every opportunities

    * Org focus on scaling, but that's not what people want.
    * Reasonable squeaks out the magic for moments
    * You need to fight the reasonable solutions, and go for the extraordinary.

    * Bad 360 report
        * Negative feedback as way to grow - instead of moping
