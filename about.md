Ira Glass, the host of This American Life, eloquently explains this blog's Raison d'Etre in the video below.

Expressed plainly - getting good at hard stuff takes LOTS of practice and LOTS of feedback, during which time the stuff you do will suck.

I want to get great at understanding, reasoning, and presenting ideas, and have no fear of sucking, so I'll use this blog to collect, massage, and present ideas.

This is also my implementation of [evergreen notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4SDCZQeRo4xFEQ8H4qrSqd68ucpgE6LU155C), which is a very interesting concept that was "discovered" in 2020, where I started in 2013 :)

A few of the posts here will be finished, but most posts will be incomplete, and many will be incoherent. If anything strikes your fancy holler, I'd love to riff on the ideas.

Finally the metaphorical small print: These are my personal opinions, not those of my employer.

## FAQ

### Are you OK having this sucky stuff?

Getting good at hard stuff takes LOTS of practice and LOTS of feedback, during which time the stuff you do will suck. Go watch Ira's talk above.

### Why are these thoughts half baked?

This is my implementation of [evergreen notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4SDCZQeRo4xFEQ8H4qrSqd68ucpgE6LU155C), which is a very interesting concept that was "discovered" in 2020, where I started in 2013 :) Read more about the notes, especially the idea of knowledge work getting better and better.

### Can I copy this stuff?
