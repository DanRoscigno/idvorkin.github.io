title: System Design Questions
---

As a technologist I love system designs. I like to tell interview candidates you don't need to practice them, it's what you do every day. In fact, it's one of the favorite parts of my technical role. I never liked crossword puzzles, but I could totally do system design problems instead. Here's a great list ..

Most of these are copied from the system design interview books/tutorials.
