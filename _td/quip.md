My group lives in QUIP. Here are some tips for my quip usage.

Quip is a shared document editor. Here are my tips to be collected.

- Keep outline mode on (View -> Collapse Ouline Mode)
- Keep chat mode off
- Collapse Sidebars
- Use the recent edits tab
- Use the Quick Open view
- Use a 're-use existing tab' to avoid re-opening the same page in several tabs
- Use alfred search history plugin.

### Keyboard shortcuts

- Keyboard shortcuts (C-/)
- Quick Open (/)

### FAQ

#### Quip app vs Quip Web

I don't see a lot of difference between the web version and the app version, so I'll use the web version where I can run greasemonkey scripts.

#### Quip vs OneNote vs etc.

Haven't thought hard about it, basically use what the group uses.
