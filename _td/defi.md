### MEV

[Miner extractable value (MEV)](https://medium.com/flashbots/frontrunning-the-mev-crisis-40629a613752) is a measure to study the profit of a miner (or validator, sequencer, or other privileged protocol actor) can make through their ability to arbitrarily include, exclude, or re-order transactions from the blocks they produce. MEV includes both ‘conventional’ profits from transaction fees and block rewards, and ‘unconventional’ profits from transaction reordering, transaction insertion, and transaction censorship within the block a miner is producing.
