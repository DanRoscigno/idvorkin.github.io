Long ago a fork from vim emerged. Neovim! I avoided it for a long time, but when Bram (the inventor of vim) died, I decided it was time to switch. Here are my thoughts and configuration

## The good

### Lively active development

### Telescope, LSP, CMP, Treesitter

### Git tooling

#### NeoGit
#### DiffViewOnly
#### Gitsigns


## The weird

### Lua

I don't like LUA, I really don't. Luckily, I can mostly use ChatGPT to translate my code to Lua successfull.y Now that I'm over the initial hump, maybe I'll even come to terms with it's nice features.

### Terminal/Shell Differences

### Prettier UX doesn't work well under Mosh (need to use SSH)
