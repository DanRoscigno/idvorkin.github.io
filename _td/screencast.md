Screencasting has become an essential tool for content creators, educators, and professionals alike. In this post, I'll share my experiences and insights on screencasting on macOS, covering various tools, techniques, and tips I've discovered along the way. From recording software to post-production enhancements, this guide aims to help you navigate the world of screencasting on your Mac.

### Actual Recording

[QuickRecorder](https://github.com/lihaoyun6/QuickRecorder) - Looks like new in 2024, and so far, works great!

- Multi-window capture
- Latest APIs
- Includes Microphone

### Facecam

- Built into QuickRecorder, but I've been using Hand Mirror, and like it.
- I use scripts to position it.

### Microphone cleanup

TBD if I need this.

### Hosting - YouTube!

### Video trimming

- Built-in trimmer
- Probably find a nicer one like what Loom does (maybe CapCut)

### Captions and Chapters

ChatGPT prompts

### Mouse Key Press Overlay

- [KeyCastr](https://github.com/keycastr/keycastr)
- Mouse - TBD

### Previous approaches

#### FFMPEG

1. Too low level

#### OBS

1. Too painful to set up capture and screen size

#### Loom

Loom should be perfect, and if I could get it working perfectly, I'd probably use it. It's great because:

1. Video edit via text transcript
   1. Remove ah and ums
1. Window/Application capture
1. Mouse Capture

Cool, but I've had a few issues:

1. Screen capture is super slow, stopping fails. Not sure what the issue is, happens on multiple computers.
1. It's 20 bucks a month. Ouch
