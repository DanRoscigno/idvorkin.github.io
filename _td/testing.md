If it's not tested, it doesn't work'.' Quality can not be outsourced.

## Why test?

Software needs to work, and if it's not tested, it doesn't work. In the rare event it works today, I assure you it'll stop workign after you make a change. If you can't make a change safely, your system will go to shit instantly.

Very related to [design](/td/design)

- SOLID designs (OO joke there, haha!)
- Safe to refactor
- Always safe to deploy
- System is well documented

## Types of tests

### Acceptance Tests

### End To End Tests - Expensive but critical

### Snapshot Tests - Validating UX

### Integration Tests -

### Unit Tests - The code does what the developer wants.

Back in the 2000s, "amazing developers" walked through all their code in the debugger to make sure it was doing what was expected. But like all manual activities this gets dreary, error prone and skipped. Instead, write unit tests to ensure your code works as you expect.
