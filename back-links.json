The addiction becomes the shadow version, the evil twin of our calling to service or to art. That’s why addicts are so interesting and so boring at the same time. They’re interesting because they’re called to something — something new, something unique, something that we, watching, can’t wait to see them bring forth into manifestation. At the same time, they’re boring because they never do the work. The addiction becomes his purpose, his novel, his adventure, his great love. The work of art or service that might have been produced is replaced by the drama, conflict, and suffering of the addict’s crazy, haunted, shattered life.\n\n",

      "description": "Internal incubations are fun, but I love shipping products. In the case of Microsoft Cache, before I joined, the team had been incubating OneClip, and needed help bringing it to market. My self and a top tier product manager joined the team to help them ship. We immediately got to work, recruiting senior talent, and closing the gaps. We tackled the technical, product market fit, and logistical issues required to bring the product to market.\n\nYou can see the\n\n\n\nfeatures we shipped\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhile the Slashgear article below captures the story well …\n</span>\n\nInstead of simply keeping all its eggs in its own Window 10 or Windows 10 Mobile basket, Microsoft, either officially or through its Garage skunkworks arm, has been steadily putting out mobile apps that cross the platform divide into iOS and Android territory, ranging from the useful to the insane. One of the latest, fortunately, straddles the useful category. Microsoft Garage’s new Cache app lets you clip anything and sync those between Windows and iOS devices. We say “new” because, truth be told, it sounds a lot like Microsoft’s “OneClip” tool from last year.\n\n\n\nAs part of its attempt to modernize its Office suite, Microsoft was spotted working on some new “smart” tools, one of which was OneClip. Taking a cue perhaps from OneNote, OneClip would have given users a sort of “stash” for notes, links, images, and files, accessible from any device. We haven’t heard from OneClip since, but that might all be moot now if it has, indeed, evolved into “Cache”.\n\n\n\nThe basic premise of Cache is totally the same, just independent of Microsoft Office, has a nice interface, and has more features. For example, it remembers where and when you “clipped” an object, so you can get back to the source if you need it. You can also organize Cache’s contents by date or into your own custom grouping.\n\nBut best of all, Cache isn’t limited to Windows only. It works on iOS too and the cache is synced on both devices through the cloud. An Android app is still missing, though, and no word yet on when, or even if, that is coming. It would be a terrible shame if it didn’t.\n",

Weight is essential because it reduces the effort required to do physical activities, and because it reduces the risk of many diseases. Exercise, while critical to energy, is mostly a red herring for weight loss. A great way to see this is comparing what you eat to physical Activity. A side of fries adds 500 calories to your day, but running for 30 minutes only burns 300 calories.\n\n",

Doing this:\n\n    \n      Gives clarity to your needs in the relationships.\n      Gives “psychic space” for other party in relationship\n      Lets you be objectives about your needs, and your expectations from other party.\n    \n  \n  Own your life\n    \n      Need self-understanding and self-responsibility\n        \n          Just self-understanding => self-pity\n          Just self-responsibility => self-blame.\n        \n      \n      Self blame => Past looking, I WAS a failure.\n      Self responsibility => Forward looking what CAN I do to make this successful?\n      (really it’s the next section, where ‘self/life’ is the relationship)\n    \n  \n  Own your relations\n    \n      When you point a finger at someone, 3 fingers point back at you.\n      All relationships are two ways streets, if there’s a problem, you own a CHUNK.\n      Leave the blame territory, and enter the how do we improve this in the future territory.\n      Know what you bring to the relationship, and what is negotiable and non-negotiable from the other party\n      Great Anecdote on divorce requirements.\n    \n  \n  Own your needs\n    \n      BATNA, how you satisfy your needs in case you can’t get a WIN/WIN?\n      Inner BATNA - know YOU WILL ALWAYS meet your needs, so don’t have to worry.\n      Gives you confidence that you don’t need to be desperate.\n    \n  \n  From blame to responsibility\n    \n      Touching story about author’s dying daughter Gabi, and how hard it was to deal with doctors.\n      Two top changes:\n        \n          Needed to stop expecting things from doctor’s they could provide for themselves, and let dr’s bring only what they needed to bring, their expertise.\n          Needed to stop blaming life for a bum deal, and instead take responsibility for making the most out of what they had.\n        \n      \n    \n  \n\n\n3) Reframe your picture ☐\n\nAbundance not Scarcity: A rising tide raises all boats\n\nExpecations are a self fulling prophecy.

Plan: Go through\nallow list of backlist pages (enumerate collections, remove indexes) For each\npage, build a list of referenced pages, and add them to a map of page to\nreference. Go through the map, and apply them (title, list of references) to\npages. ### How to Inject back links into the output content Inject into source\nor output Need to inject into source as output is regenerated.
