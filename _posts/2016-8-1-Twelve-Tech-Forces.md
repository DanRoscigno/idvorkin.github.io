Technology has evolved and is continuing to evolve, this book explores some major trends.

### Essential Concepts:


### Becoming

* Technology is now a service, and self upgrading.
* You'll always be a newbie, since software is self updating, and changing quickly. 
* Life span most phone apps is 30 days - everything is displaced before you can figure it out.
* Today's problems caused by yesterday's success - so pain causes a a steady accumulation of small benefits.
*  Protopyia - (Process and Progress):  Every day is a bit better then yesterday, and realy adds up.
* When making new tech, always start by cloning old tech - web sites clones of desktop apps. Office clone of 'physical office'
* Original idea of web -> TV, but with infinite channels. 
    * This model is blocked by who can afford to create so much content?
    * Magic - people create their own content - WHO'D HAVE THOUGHT?
* Modern system:
    * Users do most of the work - craigs list, e-bay, youtube, facebook - platforms fasicilate but create no content.
    * Amazon's big value is reviews.
* Content Manufactoring
    * High value content is NOT created by commercial entities (or classic commercial entities)
* Web in 2050, not a better web, no more then Web 2.0 is a better TV. 
* WEB TODAY:
    * What can be searched on google.
    * File sreachable via hyperlink - BUT - So mNAY things not linkable.
* WEB FUTURE:
    * More digital content - specific facebook messages
    * Image search, blue pails in my photot
    * PHysical world - keys in my room
    * Time - Last year - with models, predict into future.
* Web becomes conversational interface (as opposed to a place)
    * Went from cyber space -> ubiquitous assistant -> electricity.
