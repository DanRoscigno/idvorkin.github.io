The digital revolution has gone through 3 changes: the copy of the industrial age, the link age, and the streaming age. This is a summary of the concepts representing the new age.

### Ages of computing

* Copy Industrial Age: Hierarchy
    * Desktops, folders, files, Memos , long batch mode (months/weeks)
* Link Age: Flat web of links
    * Browser, Web, hyperlinking, Emails, Search (days)
* Streaming Age: Flows of information
    * Feeds/channels, tidbits, unbundling, tags, slack/IM, (instant)   

### Streaming age

* Instant more important then access 
    * non-netflix movies don't exist.
    * not on kindle doesn't exist
* Nouns liquify and shift to verbs*
    * One Note -> Work Flowy | Google Keep
    * Documents -> editing/sharing/reading/content snacking.    
    * Seems deep - find others.
    * App names - Scheduly

* Streaming implies the cloud, not personal ownership.


### (TBD) Case study of flowing: Music and Music Industry.

*  Playbook for other industries.

### How to add value when copies are free

* Immediacy  (Realtime/On Demand Value Add)
    * Give it to you now.
    * First for online banking
    * Amazon Prime
    * Stock Quotes
    * Early Access/Betas (Kick starter)

* Personalization 
    * Change the movie to have more of what I like in it. 
    * Watching with Family make it 'G Rated'
    * Some time to talk with the author.  (Kick starter)

* Interpretation (Consulting/Coaching)
    * Software is free, but I show you how to use it.
    * Consulting business model.
    * Red hat, MS consulting services.
    * Squash coach

* Authenticity (Status, Moral Value, Risk Reduction)
    * Some people really value that for brand status.
    * Important if risk possible - like stolen software tampered with.
    * IPhone and Jail Breaking.
    * Software on the internet.

* Accessibility (Storage provider Value add)
    * Physical assets as a service (Uber)
    * Production tool as a service (Creative Cloud)
    * My owned content as a service (Flickr)
    * I could own the copy, but storage provide value add.
    * Digital books can be copied, but Amazon Kindle stores my highlights. Gives me flash cards.
    * My photo provide - Google Photos/Flickr

* Embodiment (The physical experience/scarcity value add) 
    * People really value this - music concerts/live theatre/physical book
    * Book free, but generic author talk.
    * Holding a book.

* Patronage (I'm part of the process value add - Kick Starter)
    * Fans want to support.
    * 4 conditions: Easy; Reasonable Amount; Clear Benefit; Money goes to creator

* Discoverability (Help me find it/recommendation system):
    * Crowd sourcing (amazon/netflix rating)
    * Big compute/Deep Learning (Page Rank)
    * Trusted Curators
    * Tribes
* Notice how many of these values are kick-start rewards.
* Igor's to file
    * Trust
    * Service plans/insurance



### Old models for adding value
* Distribution
* Artificial Scarcity
* Limited Distribution (copy right/suing)

### Fixity vs Fluidity of industrial age goods (E.g. book)

* The old fixed way: 
    * Fixed Content
    * Fixed Presentation
    * Fixed Container (Durable)
    * Complete

* The new way:
    * Fluid Content - If I've read previous book, skip previous book summaries.
    * Fluid PresentationLook - best for phones vs desktop
    * Fluid Container - Put it on any device/screen I have.
    * Fluid Completion - Always updated to be accurate, auto updating graphs.

### Evolution From Fixed to Flowing

* Fixed / Rare - Only makable by artisan/expert
* Free / Ubiquitous - Cheap perfect copies
* Flowing/ Sharing - Break product into parts. Share Remix. Platform.
* Open / End user Creation - Cheap tools, Audience is creator.


### Becoming

* Technology is now a service, and self upgrading.
* You'll always be a newbie, since software is self updating, and changing quickly. 
* Life span most phone apps is 30 days - everything is displaced before you can figure it out.
* Today's problems caused by yesterday's success - so pain causes a a steady accumulation of small benefits.
*  Protopyia - (Process and Progress):  Every day is a bit better then yesterday, and realy adds up.
* When making new tech, always start by cloning old tech - web sites clones of desktop apps. Office clone of 'physical office'
* Original idea of web -> TV, but with infinite channels. 
    * This model is blocked by who can afford to create so much content?
    * Magic - people create their own content - WHO'D HAVE THOUGHT?
* Modern system:
    * Users do most of the work - craigs list, e-bay, youtube, facebook - platforms fasicilate but create no content.
    * Amazon's big value is reviews.
* Content Manufactoring
    * High value content is NOT created by commercial entities (or classic commercial entities)
* Web in 2050, not a better web, no more then Web 2.0 is a better TV. 
* WEB TODAY:
    * What can be searched on google.
    * File sreachable via hyperlink - BUT - So mNAY things not linkable.
* WEB FUTURE:
    * More digital content - specific facebook messages
    * Image search, blue pails in my photot
    * PHysical world - keys in my room
    * Time - Last year - with models, predict into future.
* Web becomes conversational interface (as opposed to a place)
    * Went from cyber space -> ubiquitous assistant -> electricity.


### Cognifying - It's better then AI.

    * It's better with AI

### Flowing - From noun to verb

* Copyable products are the most valueable products - and that's a good thing.
* Old 'solids' are being maluable (??)
    * Durable goods as a Service/On Demand
        * Cars - Lyft/Uber
        * Vacations - Air BNB
        * Lodging - 
        * Grocery Delivery - Dash buttons, amazon fresh
        * Shopping - Amazon
        * Telphone - slightly different
        * Software - always a service constantly upgrading.
    * On Demand
