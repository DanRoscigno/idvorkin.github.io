There's lots of wisdom presented by Carlos Castaneda. Worth a quick review.

This is a summary of [Don Juan's teaching](http://kennysideshow.blogspot.com/2014/04/the-four-natural-enemies-of-man-of.html)

### Four Enemies
* Fear
  * The resistance - a desire to not do it.
  * Problem: Will stop trying because is afraid.
  * Solution: lean in, and battle till you realize there is nothing to be scared of.
 * Arrogance
    * Self Confidence, and ego
    * Problem: Won't bother  learning, or tackling new problems because thinks knows the solution.  Will push others away
    * Solution: Only use ego and confidence when it is necessary otherwise be humble and patient, make room for others.
* Authority
    * When you rely on authority, you stop using your principles, and stuff goes stuff.
    * Problem: Will abandon principles, and do what you want.
    * Solution: Only use authority when needed. Only use authority in alignment with principles, never else. Never let your authority get out of your control.
* Old Age
    * Tired: Stop caring
    * Problem: Will stop wanting to do stuff
    * Solution: Push till you die. 

### Knowledge of Death is Strength
  * Death is always an arms length away - Remember this every day.
  * How can you feel important, when you see graveyards are filled with "important men"
  * Because you'll die soon, will these petty thoughts matter?
  * When you think something is going wrong - ask death if it matters. It'll say nope, not compared to death. 

### Take Responsibility
  * Know what you want and wait for it. 
  * Suffering is in your head
  * Attachment is the cause of suffering.
  * Your body experiences emotions
  * Ponder and think before making a decision, but once made you are on the path.  There's a million new decisions to tackle.
  * Be neither idle nor in a hurry:

### Ego is the Enemy
  * Ego is the enemy, how much time is wasted feeling offended or insulted. What a waste of time. Does it matter when dead? 
  * The ego generates a subjective experience through self talk. Repeat self talk will repeat same actions

### "Igor's Philosophical Model" mapping to Don Juan
  * Fear is resistance
  * A path with heart is living by your principles. 
  * There are infinite ways to live, but not all align with your mission statement or your principles. 
  * Power = Inspiration + Confidence
  * Stopping the world: Meditation, Mindfulness
