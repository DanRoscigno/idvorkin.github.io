Biking, is something that make my very happy. Here are my notes on biking.

- To stay warm in see [this](/warm).
- My other post [bike post](https://github.com/idvorkin/techdiary/blob/master/notes/irl.md#bikes) which includes e-bikes.
- Some early thoughts on [biking](http://ighealth.blogspot.com/search/label/bike).

**Head Phones** -

AirPod Pro - I love them.

[Aftershokz Air](https://aftershokz.com/products/trekz-air) are bone conduction headphones that let you listen to music without blocking the street noise. Fantastic product.

**Light** - I'd recommend a minimum of  600 lumens, and make sure it can charge over USB.   I currently use the [urban 800](http://www.lightandmotion.com/the-perfect-light/on-bike/road/urban-800-fast-charge).  I used to use the  [Taz 1200](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008KKNPCM/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B008KKNPCM&linkCode=as2&tag=ighe-20), but it was too bulky, and I don't need that many lumens

**Locks** - I like the Bordo folding locks, and u-locks, more coming.

**Suspension seat posts** - Took me a while to try these, they're incredible.

**Panniers** - [Orltieb](http://www.rei.com/search?query=orltieb+pannier) - I couldn't believe I spent 200$ on a set of saddle bags, but true story, I bought the 50$ kind, then the 100\$ kind then finally these, and I've used them for 8 years with a single problem.

**Toe Covers** - [These](http://www.amazon.com/Meister-Thermal-Neoprene-Booties-Cycling/dp/B00QW10ZHO/ref=sr_1_7?ie=UTF8&qid=1448076697&sr=8-7&keywords=toe+warmers) work pretty well to keep your feet warm. They're easy to lose track of though.
