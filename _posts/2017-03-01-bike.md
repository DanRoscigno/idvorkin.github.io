Biking, is something that make my very happy. Here are my notes on biking:

- To stay warm in see [this](/warm).
- My other post [bike post](https://github.com/idvorkin/techdiary/blob/master/notes/irl.md#bikes) which includes e-bikes.
- Some early thoughts on [biking](http://ighealth.blogspot.com/search/label/bike).

### Stuff I use

- **Light** - I'd recommend a minimum of  600 lumens, and make sure it can charge over USB.   I currently use the [urban 800](http://www.lightandmotion.com/the-perfect-light/on-bike/road/urban-800-fast-charge).  I used to use the  [Taz 1200](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008KKNPCM/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B008KKNPCM&linkCode=as2&tag=ighe-20), but it was too bulky, and I don't need that many lumens
- **Locks** - I like the Bordo folding locks, and u-locks, more coming.
- **Suspension seat posts** - Took me a while to try these, they're [incredible](https://www.amazon.com/Suntour-SP12-NCX-Mountain-Suspension-Seatpost/dp/B01HMXE8ZU/).
- **Panniers** - [Orltieb](http://www.rei.com/search?query=orltieb+pannier) - I couldn't believe I spent 200$ on a set of saddle bags, but true story, I bought the 50$ kind, then the 100\$ kind then finally these, and I've used them for 8 years without a single problem.
- **Ergo Grips** - They're [great](https://www.amazon.com/Ergon-GS3-Grips-Large-Black/dp/B00GPSO3VI/).
- Hydraulic Disc Breaks - I don't have them yet, but will soon.

I've been through a few types of headphones:

- AirPod Pro - I love them.
- [Aftershokz Air](https://aftershokz.com/products/trekz-air) are bone conduction headphones that let you listen to music without blocking the street noise. Fantastic product, but I prefer the AirPod Pros
