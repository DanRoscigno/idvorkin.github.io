Having our emotions heard fundamental human need. The modern world denies this, but this doesn't make the need go away. So beyond denying our need, society gives us, and encourages us, to use tools to suppress our emotions.  

Feelings meetings, stand in opposition. They are a forum designed to enable us, even encourage us, to fulfill our fundamental need by expressing emotion.  I learned this practice from [Lawrence Ripsher](http://lawrenceripsher.com/), a most impressive fellow.

Feelings meetings area a part of my [eulogy](http://idvorkin.github.io/Igor-Eulogy), so here I am recording my thoughts on the meetings:

Each meeting opens with with a standard spiel.

* This meeting is forum to have our emotions heard.
* Strictly confidential, if you can't honor that, please leave.
* Must be uncomfortable, if it's not, we're doing it wrong. Try not to break tension through jokes or fidgeting.
* Listen to the emotions, not the words - if you want to clarify, or problem solve, focus on hearing the emotions.

Rituals let us get into the "spirit" of the feeling meeting faster. Some of our rituals:

* Bring a box, place all of our electronics into it. 
* Remove the table, and sit in the smallest circle we can.
* Begin the meeting with the standard spiel.
* Set a timer for the end of the meeting, so no one needs to look at the time.


People ask me why this meeting works, here's my current thinking:
* Emotions need to get out. 
* Normally:
    * We are encouraged not to think about our emotions
    * We make an effort, often sub concious,  not to think of our emotions.
    * We release the tension in other ways - Telling dismissive jokes, fidgeting, thinking.
    * Distract: Watch TV, Eat Junk food
    * We mute: Booze, Drugs, 
* Feelings meeting is different:
    * We are encouraged to express emotions
    * Those around us are expressing emotions, which stirs ours.
    * Force tension, try to block tension release.
    * As tension goes up, the more you need to express your emotions.
