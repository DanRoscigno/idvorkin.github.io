Mindfulness, or emotional intelligence (EI), for Engineers, is what I'd call this book. It describes how to build EI.

This is a summary of [Search Inside Yourself](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0070XF474/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?ie=UTF8&btkr=1)

### 1) What is Emotional Intelligence (EI)? How to train it? &#x2611; 
_Even engineers can use empathy_

* __GOAL:EI is a collection of trainable skills, this book teaches them.__
* IE is Ability to monitor your, and others, feelings, and use the info to guide your own thinking and actions.
* Background on EI:  [What makes a leader](/what-makes-a-leader-great) article.
* Foundational Skill 1: Focus attention
* Foundational Skill 2: Perceive feelings in the body since body manifests feelings
    1. before mind realizes it
    2. with more granularity.
* Mindfulness is THE WAY to build those foundational skills.
* Once have the mindfulness can use to build the components of EI.
* Easy and Easier Mindfulness Methods. __Easy__ follow the breath.  __Easier__ have no thoughts.
 
### 2) Theory and practice of mindfulness &#x2611;
_Breathing as if your life depends on it._

* __GOAL: Be Relaxed, Non Judgmental, and Alert at the same time.__
* Meditation trains Attention(ability to concentrate), Meta-Attention(notice not paying attention).
    * Like bike balancing. Constantly re-balancing so seems like rider always balanced.
* Meditation is like exercise 
    * Work out, tough work out, much better then no workout. 
    * More you practice stronger you become.
    * After a while, you just feel better and not sure why.
* Intention - Intention == Affirmation == mental habit == good.
* __Grandmother mind:__ be gentle with yourself, the more you do it, the more of a habit it becomes.
* Process Model: 
    * External Observer: Follow Breath, Distracted, Regain Focus
* Dealing with distraction
    * Experience without judging or reacting
    * If you need to react, continue being mindful
    * Let it go
    * Sitting Time
* Concepts I'm not summarizing
    * Proper meditation posture
    * Dude where is the science.
    * Happiness default state of mind.

### 3) Extend mindfulness beyond formal practice. &#x2611; 
_Mindfulness without butt on cushion_

* __Goal: Extend from formal to informal situations (rest to activity) and from self to others.__
* Mindfulness in activity
    * Will happen naturally from formal practice, but you can accelerate it.
    * Imagine focusing on every meal as if it was prepared by a world class chef.
    * Walking can be a formal "activity based" meditation.
* Directing mindfulness on others. Informal/formal practice of mindful listening/conversation.
    * Focusing on others, give them your full, non-judgmental attention.
* Formal Practice of Mindful Listening
    * Speaker: Speak for 3 uninterrupted minutes. You own them, even if silence.
    * Listener: No speaking, acknowledge (maybe, but don't over acknowledge). If silence, be silent.
    * Swap speaker.
    * Meta conversation on process: How do you feel, anything you want to talk about.
* Informal Practice of Mindful Listening
    * Give the gift of your full attention.
    * Because they're your close one, they deserve time and space to express themselves.
    * When attention wanders, bring it back.
* Mindful Conversation
    * A. Mindful Listening
    * B. Looping - close the loop, by repeating what you think you understood. Speaker works with you till fully understood.
    * C. Dipping - We usually don't listen as we've wandered off.  Dip into yourself
            * Listener - notice if you're being distracted, try to let it go. 
            * Speaker  - notice how this makes you feel, decide to talk about it, or let it go.
* Formal Mindful Conversation
    * Monologue 4 minutes: * Listener:  Pay attention, and periodically dip.
    * Looping: 6 minutes to describe what i heard, and loop.
    * Meta: 4 minutes meta conversation.
* Informal Mindful Conversation
    * Just like formal method, but you don't tell. 
    * Be sure to seek permission for looping - what you said sounds important, can I check what I understood?
    * Consider explaining what you did, and let the other person join you.
* Sustaining your practice
    * Like exercise, only hard for first few months. Tips
        1. Have a buddy ask: Am I doing it? Why is my life better? How did this conversation go? 
        1. Do less then you can
        1. At a minimum, do a breat/1 minute/2 minute.
    * Keep the difficulty at just below what you can achieve - think of how video games work.
* Lightness and Joy in Mediation
    * Want a relaxed (light) focus on meditation. Try meditating on Joyful event.
        * Bring full attention to something pleasant, holding kids hand, a nice meal, etc.
    * Theory: This gain can be generalized to other practices, but still need formal meditation.
    * Eventually Meditation causes - Sukha - non-energy expending joy.
* Mastering focused and open attention:
    * Focused attention - intense focus on chosen object.
    * Open attention - let focus move to any incoming event without judgement.
    * Values from circuits
        * Requires Strong Meta Attention to stay on focus
        * Strong clarity - analogy, strong torch light
        * Relaxed Attention - needed so don't get exhausted from meditation.
* Meditation Circuit Training (4x) 
    * 3 minute closed - keep focus on breath.
    * 3 minutes open - allow focus to apply to each incoming thought
* Stay motivated - you're going to suck till you don't
* Walking Meditation
    * Focus on walking while walking.
    * Feel your feet touching the ground
    * Don't take anything forgranted.

### 4) Self awareness leading to self confidence &#x2611; 
_All natural organic Self-Confidence_

* __GOAL:  Emotional Awareness -> Self Assessment -> Self Confidence__
* Self Awareness - The basis of EI - Your internal state, preferences, resources, and intuitions.
    * Emotional Awareness 
        * Resolution - See subtle differences between emotions.
        * Vividness - Turn up the contrast, so we can see easily see the additional resolution.
        * (Am Happy -> Feel Happy -> Experiance Happy in my Body)
        * The moment you observe an emotion, it's already less powerful.
    * Accurate Self Assement - Strengths and Weakness
        * Essential for managers. 
        * We're not perfect, but how can we succeed despite these gaps.
    * Self Confidence - Ego as big as Mt Fugi, or as small as grain of sand as needed.
        * Ego gets in the way of listening, need to let it go to be open.
        * Ego required when doing hard tasks like leading, need it to grow to take on the challenge
        * You can admit weakness, without self-blaming 
        * Grandma Mind requires huge confidence
* From Emotional Awareness to Self Confidence
    * Emotional Awareness -> Self Assessment -> Self Confidence
        * Engineers confident in systems when understand operational, failure, and error recovery behaviors.
        * Understand operational, failure, and error recovery behaviors -> Self Assessment.
        * Self Assement has low SNR because of emotions . Boost Emotional Awareness -> Boost Self Assessment SNR
    * Misc
        * More we study ourselves, more objective we can become.
        * We know all the skeletons in our closets, and can deal with them.
