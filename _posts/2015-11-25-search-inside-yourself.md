Mindfulness, or emotional intelligence (EI), for Engineers, is what I'd call this book. It describes how to build EI.

This is a summary of [Search Inside Yourself](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0070XF474/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?ie=UTF8&btkr=1)

### 1) What is Emotional Intelligence (EI)? How to train it? 
_Even engineers can use empathy_

* Define IE: Ability to monitor your, and others, feelings, and use the info to guide your own thinking and actions.
* Background on EI:  [What makes a leader](/what-makes-a-leader-great) article.
* The Point: EI is a collection of trainable skills, this book teaches them.
* Foundational Skill 1: Focus attention
* Foundational Skill 2: Perceive feelings in the body since body manifests A) feeling before 'mind realizes it, B)  feelings with more granularity.
* Mindfulness is THE WAY to build those foundational skills.
* Once have the mindfulness can use to build the components of EI.
* Easy and Easier Mindfulness Methods. __Easy__ follow the breath.  __Easier__ have no thoughts.
 
### 2) Theory and practice of mindfulness
_Breathing as if your life depends on it._

* Relaxed and Alert at the same time.
* Meditation trains Attention(ability to concentrate), Meta-Attention(notice not paying attention).
* Attention + Meta-Attention, like bike balancing. Constantly re-balancing till seems like always balanced.
* Meditation is like exercise 
    * Work out, tough work out, much better then no workout. 
    * More you practice stronger you become.
    * After a while, you just feel better and not sure why.
* Intention - Intention == Affirmation == mental habit == good.
* Grand mother mind - be gentle with yourself, the more you do it, the more of a habit it becomes.
* Process Model: 
    * External Observer: Follow Breath, Distracted, Regain Focus
* Dealing with distraction
    * Experience without judging or reacting
    * If you need to react, continue being mindful
    * Let it go
    * Sitting Time
* Concepts I'm not summarizing
    * Proper meditation posture
    * Dude where is the science.
    * Happiness default state of mind.
