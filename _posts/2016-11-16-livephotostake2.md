The reason I own an iPhone is Live Photos. When you take a picture, it adds a bit of video to make it live. When ever you see a picture you can click on it to make it live. Laphs is a javascript library which makes it easy to implement live photos on the web. 

Below is a simple example - press the photo to see it live. 

<img 
src="https://idvorkin.s3.amazonaws.com/livephotos/tori_wings/photo.jpg"
data-live-photo="https://idvorkin.s3.amazonaws.com/livephotos/tori_wings/photo.mov"
data-live-photo-still-image-time="1.71"/>

If you want to implement this yourself check out -  [laphs](https://github.com/tumblr/laphs).
