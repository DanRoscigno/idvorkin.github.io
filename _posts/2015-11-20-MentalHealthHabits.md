Emotionally healthy folks can let it go, empathize with others, and most importantly, sleep well at night.

Just like physically healthy folks do physical practices, like walking daily, stretching, biking, there are also emotional practices. Here are the ones I've been exploring.


### Daily Stream of Conciousness Journalling 

__Why?__ I'm a ruminator. Both positive and negative thoughts get stuck in a loop in my head, creating cognitive load, and distracting me from the present. By taking a few minutes to "drain" the ideas in my head, many of the ideas will go away, or at least be much less interrupting

__How?__  Every day I take 10 minutes to write about 750 words as quickly as I can on the ideas sloshing around in my head. I do it on [750words](http://www.750words.com) which is optimized for this practice.

__How's that working out for you?__ Really well, this is my most consistent practice. Since [September 2011][http://ighealth.blogspot.com/2012/01/750wordscom.html], I've written over a million words on more then 1300 days.
