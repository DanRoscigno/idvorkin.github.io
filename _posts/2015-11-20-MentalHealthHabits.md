## Practices

Here are the practices I do, and my level of succcess

### Daily Stream of Conciousness Journalling 

__Why?__ I'm a ruminator. Both positive and negative thoughts get stuck in a loop in my head, creating cognative load, and distracting me from the present. By taking a few minutes to "drain" the ideas in my head, many of the ideas will go away, or atleast be much less interupting

__How?__  Every day I take 10 minutes to write about 750 words as quickly as I can on the ideas sloshing around in my head. I do it on [750words](http://www.750words.com) which is optimized for this practice.

__How's that working out for you?__ Really well, this is my most consistent practcice. Since [September 2011][http://ighealth.blogspot.com/2012/01/750wordscom.html], I've written over a million words on more then 1300 days.
