Emotionally healthy folks can let it go, empathize with others, and most importantly, sleep well at night.

Just like physically healthy folks do physical practices, like walking daily, stretching, biking, there are also emotional practices. Here are the ones I've been exploring.


### Daily Stream of Conciousness Journalling 

__Why?__ I'm a ruminator. Both positive and negative thoughts get stuck in a loop in my head, creating cognitive load, and distracting me from the present. By taking a few minutes to "drain" the ideas in my head, many of the ideas will go away, or at least be much less interrupting

__How?__  Every day I take 10 minutes to write about 750 words as quickly as I can on the ideas sloshing around in my head. I do it on [750words](http://www.750words.com) which is optimized for this practice.

__How's that working out for you?__ Really well, this is my most consistent practice. Since [September 2011][http://ighealth.blogspot.com/2012/01/750wordscom.html], I've written over a million words on more then 1300 days.

### Daily Gratefulness Journal

__Why?__  It's easy to focus on what we don't have and what goes wrong, and forget all the things that go right, and that we shoudl be thankful for.  By taking a few minutes each day to remember what went well and what I'm grateful for, I'm remindeded why my life is awesome.

__How?__  I use a physical journal called [FiveMinuteJournal](http://www.FiveMinuteJournal.com), it has you list the 3 things your'e grateful for in the morning, and 3 things that went well in the evening.

__How's that working out for you?__ Really well. Because I can fill this out in less then 2 minutes, I tend to do it daily. It's hard to be objective, but since I've started this practice, I have been much more likely to think about how lucky I am.

### Formal 8-12 minute meditation

## Inconsistent/Future practices

* Process it once list
* Why is someone behaving inconsistently
* Poll the people in my head
* Forced wake up time.
* GratTweeting (very similuar to daily gratefulness journal.)
