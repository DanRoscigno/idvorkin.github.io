Physical health is the basis of energy, and thus the source of success, and a key [saw to sharpen](/sharpen-the-saw). Physical health is about weight, fitness, and sleep.

### Weight Yourself

**Weight is essential** because it reduces the effort required to do physical activities, and because it reduces the risk of diseases.

Weight is "calories in" minus "calories out." [Diet](/diet) dominates calories out, exercise has a small contribution. A great way to see this is comparing what you eat to physical Activity. A box of French fries adds 400 calories to your day, but running for 30 minutes burns 300 calories.

Set a weight goal, and check progress towards the goal weekly. It's easy for your weight to gradually creep up, and keep creeping up. Thus, I strongly recommend committing to not letting your weight exceed your goal for too long.

Personally, I set a weight pledge every month, and never exceed that weight. Some people feel dieting is shameful. I couldn't disagree more. Dieting shows you care about health and are doing something about it.

### Strength and Cardio Training

**Fitness is essential** because it's the limiting factor to what you can do.

Fitness can be endurance or strength. For the majority of activities, endurance dominates, but some minimal strength is also required. For example, being able to run 30 minutes ensures you won't be out of breath when you need to hustle to catch the bus, but being able to lift 100lbs doesn't help you in many situations. Being able to lift 10 lbs is important though, so don't completely ignore strength.

I recommend doing the most vigorous cardio activity you can comfortably do multiple times a week. It's easy to skip your activity, so try to set it up so you don' have excuses to skip.

Personally, I run 4 miles on a tread mill multiple times a week at the gym. I run inside so weather can't keep me from running, and I keep gym clothes in a locker at the gym so I can't have the "I forgot my gym shoes" excuse either.

### Sleeping soundly

**Sleep is essential** because it allows your body to heal, your brain to think clearly, and you to perform well throughout the day.

Sleep is a personal thing, with different people requiring different amounts. The amount of sleep you need should be dictated by how tired you feel.
I recommend getting as much sleep as you need.

Personally I set an alarm and always wake up at the same, regardless of how tired I am. When I'm not getting enough sleep I actually reduce my caffeine to make sure I'm so tired, I fall asleep early. Many people feel they don't have enough time for sleep, but I couldn't disagree more. Not sleeping makes everything worse, resulting in you getting less done. Getting enough sleep show you want to get the most done in your waking hours.

ps. Being a nerd I use a bunch of [toys]({% post_url 2017-10-06-tech-health-toys %}) to help with my health.

### FAQ

#### How should I start?

**My health is in the shitter - and I'm doing none of these. How should I start?**

First good for you! Realizing you need to take action is a huge first step. Realizing you need to start small and deliberate is the next huge step.

I'd start with cardio exercise (e.g. endurance fitness). That will give you the most energy, which you'll require to boost strap the other disciplines. After you've been doing that for a month or so, I'd tackle sleep and when that feels stable I'd add weight loss.

#### How long should I exercise?

**I'm in for cardio - How should I start, how long should I go?**

First rule of starting new habits - make it easier then you can accomplish. To that end I'd start at an easy pace for as long as you can (upto 30 minutes) then gradually increase the duration till you can do 30 minutes comfortably. Once you're at 30 minutes gradually raise the intensity (no more then 10% / week) so that you're continuing to push at an easy pace without feeling like you're pushing too hard.

**Why 30 minutes?**

I don't know if there's any science here, but my target is 30 minutes of cardio.

For me, it's long enough to work up a sweat, but short enough to not eat up my day. I've read that you should either do 30 minutes of low to medium intensity exercise daily or 20 minutes of high intensity exercise 3 times a week. When starting out or when old, I'd recommend low weights high reps to reduce the risk of quitting and injury.

#### My body part really hurts, what should I do?

I've had lots of injuries, here's my various [braces](/irl#physical-health)

#### Should I get a trainer?

Trainers are expensive, but heart attacks are even more expensive, and on top of money, they really suck up your energy and reduce your quality of life.

I put off getting a trainer for 20 years. I though I was very knowledgable in exercise, physiology, and was motivaed having a gym routine where I went every morning to do cardio, and I wasn't interested in getting strong. Eventually I decided I'd like some more injury prefention, so got a trainer and told him my goal was to increase my injury resillance, and he said OK, lets do mobility workouts then.

- The mobility movements are more strenous then my normal cardio routines. Every movement we do seemed like it could happen naturally through day to day activities and felt incredibly weak, a real warning to injury.

- He also took a look at my cardio routine, and changed it to be a high intensity Training - Wow, same amount of time,so much more intense, and so energized afterward.

- Many days I feel lazy, I turn off my brain and just let him tell me what to do, and when to push myself.

- I've had RSI in my wrists, injuries everywhere, and as we do exercises I can be like, oh this feels like it'll give out,and we instantly change the exercise.

In summary, trainers are worth it.
