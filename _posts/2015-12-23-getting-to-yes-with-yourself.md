Before you can negotiate with others, you need to be in sync with yourself. This book applies the negotiating principles to yourself.

This is a summary of [Getting to yes with yourself](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0070XF474/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?ie=UTF8&btkr=1)

### 1) Put yourself in your shoes &#x2611; 
* __Figure out what your elephant REALLY wants (Switch)__
* __Seek first to understand yourself (7H)__
* __When you judge yourself, you shutdown and can't find what you really want__
* __Acceptance induces safety, and only from safety can you find what you really want__
*  See yourself form the balcony
    * Respond instead of reacting.
    * Going to Balcony == Be Mindful, Self Aware and Objective
    * Choose your response, but it's a two sided stick and you get the consequences.
    * Reaction:
        * Feels good, but need to realize there is a VERY negative consequence.
        * Negative Reactions: Attack (Win:Lose) -> Accommodate (Lose:Win) -> Avoid (Lose:Lose)
    * Use self-awareness to catch your desire to react
        * Need to build self-awareness muscle (SIY)
        * Practice mindfulness (and have a grounding spot)
        * Practice mindfulness before event to make it easier.
*  Listen with Empathy
    * 80% of thoughts are negative.    
    * Observe self: Detached view of a scientist.
    * Listen to self: What it feels like to be you.
    * Listening to self exercise
        * Don't judge, or they will not feel safe, and won't talk.
        * Name your neurosis, and sit them down at a table, and listen to them non-judgementally
        * Because "negative emotions are safe to speak" they get less power, and have less desire to attack at "bad" times.
        * Don't just listen, understand the cause, and what you can do to help.
        * Be curious, ask yourself, isn't that interesting. Ask the neurosis, why is that.
    * This is an opportunity to learn physical self awareness, to help notice your emotions.
    * Huge benefit, your mind is more clear, and you silence the self to concentrate and get  into flow.
*  Uncover your needs 
    * Your elephant is non-verbal, negative emotions are it's mode of communicating your needs.
    * Dig hard for your needs, don't settle for a position, but why, what do you really want. What is done. (XREF: Essentialisim)
    * Magic Question Why? Why? Why?
    * Deepest needs: Happiness: Protection/Safety and Love/Connection
*  From Self Judgment to Self Understanding
    * Before fighting with others, need to make sure you TRUELY know what you want.
    * Accepting yourself for who you are is NOT a cop out. Acceptance produces safety, which lets us digg deater.
