The business model is a tool for understanding how a company makes money. We can apply the same canvas to a person, here's me applying it to mine. 

### Essential Concepts:

* Build your value, not your skills
* Focus customers on the value you provide, not your key activities.
* Focus customers on their job - remind them your job is to support them, not do the activities they 'hire you for'
* Determine what key activites will support the value you provide.

### Key Resources - Who you are/What you have:

* Interests - Things that excite you
* Abilites - Things that are effortless
* Skills - Learned or Aquired Talents
* Personality - How people describe 'you'
* Intangible Assets - IP/Goodwill/Brand Recogintion
* Physical Assets - N/A for computer people.

### Key Activities - What you do:

### Customers - Who you help:

### Value Provided - How you help:

### Channels - How they know you, how you deliver

More complex then it sounds:

* How will potential customers discover how you help them?
* How will they decide whether to buy your product or services?
* How will they buy it?
* How will you deliver it?
* How will you follow up ot make sure you are succesful?

### Customer Relationships - How do you interact?

* How do you communicate (in person, newsletter)?
* What is the frequency?
* Is the goal retention or Aquisition?


### Key Partners - Who helps you?

* Up/Down/Side Ways
* Close/Frequent relations - sister team.
* On Demand - Mentors/Advisors


### Revenue - What you get?

* Tangible
* Intangible

### Costs - What you give?

* Tangible

    * Time 
    * Training

* Intangible

    * Stress
