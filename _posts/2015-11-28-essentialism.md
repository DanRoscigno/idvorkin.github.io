Essentialism is deciding what goes on your todo list, not how many things you can cross off.

_Essentialisim is similar to strategy, as well as outsourcing_ 

This is a summary of [Essentialisim](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00G1J1D28/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?ie=UTF8&btkr=1)

### 1) Essence
tbd

### 2) Choose
tbd

### 3) Discern
tbd

### 4) Trade off &#x2611; 
* Try to avoid reality of trade-offs, but in reality they can't be ignored.
* Exist, can't be ignored. 
* Embrace them 

### 5) Escape &#x2611; 
* Need to make space to think
* To have focus, need to escape, to be able TO FOCUS.
* Space to concentrate
* Space to read

### 6) Look
tbd
* The big picture
* Filtering For Fascinating
* Keep a journal
* Get out into the field
* Key your eyes peeled for abnormal or weird
* Clarify the question
    * Easy to answer something else.
    * Instead, understand the importance and essence of the question, and come back and answer it.

### 7) Play
tbd

### 8) Sleep &#x2611; 
* Don't sleep, don't think. Don't think, can't choose well.

### 9) Select
tbd

### 10) Clarify
tbd

### 11) Dare
tbd

### 12) Uncommit
tbd

### 13) Edit
tbd

### 14) Limit
tbd

### 15) Buffer &#x2611; 
* REALITY: You just can't predict, add buffer.
* Your estimate is wrong, add 50% buffer.
* IF you don't need your buffer, you'll get free time and feel great.
* DO NOT ASSUME BEST CASE.
* Scenario planning.
    * What risks do you face on this project
    * What is the worst case scenario
    * What would make the social effects of this be
    * What would the financial impacts be
    * How can you invest to reduce risks or strengthen resilliance

### 16) Subtact &#x2611; 
* Shipping is blocked by constraints/obstacles on the long pole.
* Produce by removing constraints/obstacles on the long pole, not be doing more work on other things.
* __You ship by cutting features, not by adding features__
* __Mythical Man Month__ - Ignoring the constraints, adding more production capacity.
* Example, Boy scout hike, make the slowest hiker more efficient, put him at front of line, and help him.
* Find and fix the long pole.
    1.   __How do we know we're done?__ Crisp, specific statement of done.
    2.   __What is holding that back?__
        *  List+Rank: What is keeping me from completing this? 
        *  List+Rank: What obstacle, if removed, would make the majority of other obstacles dissapear? 
        * Focus on top of list.
    3.   __Remove Top Problem__
        * Too high a quality? Change perspective - done is better then perfect.
        * Blocked on person? Ask them slowest hiker, and what you can do to help.
* Grandmother mind again - it's hard, but the first step makes a difference.
### 17) Progress &#x2611; 
* __Drip, Drip, Drip, Done.__
* Progress most motivating because 1) momentum 2) reminds future success.
* Create small wins, celebrate progress
* Focus on small wins till done, forcing a big win much harder.
* Do the minimal viable progress
    * Easy to know you're tackling a small chunk.
    * Done is better then perfect
    * Leave state where it's much easier to start (aka. Call Susan @ 206-925-3219, as opposed to call susan)
    * Pixar: We don't actually finish our films, we ship them.
* Start minimum viable preperation as early as you can.
    * Start early and small.
    * It's not intimidating, and you can get so much done before it's urgent.
    * Seeing the progress makes it easy to take the next step.
* The more clear progress, the better - put things on your wall, add check marks
    * Bonus, seeing success makes us enjoy and have satisfaction the process.
* TODO: Figure out systems that make this easier:
   * Book summary - start with chapter outline, then section out line per section, the flesh out. Progress helps.
   * Scrum and Kanban.
   * Bug Burn down charts.

### 18) Flow &#x2610;
* Making it look easy
* The power of the right routine
    *   Overhaul your triggers
    *   Create new triggers
    *   Do the most difficult thing first
    *   Mix up your routines
    *   Takle your routines one by one.

### 19) Focus
tbd

### 20) Be &#x2611; 
* Always ask what is most essential, cut everything else
* Choosing and your todo list:
    * Life is about what you decide to put on your todo list, not how efficiently you cross things off.
    * Focus on essential is a choice, make it, or someone else will make your choices, and it'll suck.
* Regressions:
    * You'll forget that you can't do both, you can't.
    * They'll happen, keep grandmother mind, and try again.
* Living a life that matters: 
    * Family most important thing in your life, everything else will fade over time.
    * You have so little time -- go look at cemeteries to see how little you have. 
    * Remove fear of choosing the wrong thing, just choose and move on.
    * By deciding what is most important and doing it, you'll have no regrets.
