### 20) Be 
* Always ask what is most essential, cut everything else
* Choosing and your todo list:
    * Life is about what you decide to put on your todo list, not how efficiently you cross things off.
    * Focus on essential is a choice, make it, or someone else will make your choices, and it'll suck.
* Regressions:
    * You'll forget that you can't do both, you can't.
    * They'll happen, keep grandmother mind, and try again.
* Living a life that matters: 
    * Family most important thing in your life, everything else will fade over time.
    * You have so little time -- go look at cemeteries to see how little you have. 
    * Remove fear of choosing the wrong thing, just choose and move on.
    * By deciding what is most important and doing it, you'll have no regrets.
