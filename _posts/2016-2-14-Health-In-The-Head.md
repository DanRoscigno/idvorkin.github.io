Sleight of mind is about how to cause cognative reframes.

### 1: Language -> Experiances

#### Words matter - as simple as 'and', 'but' or 'even though'

A and B stresses B. If A is the positive use the even though pattern.

* __A and B__: It's sunny today AND raining tommorrow
     * Equal weight A and B
* __A but B__: It's sunny today BUT raining tommorrow
     *  B is empasized.
* __A even though B__: It's sunny today even though it's raining tommorrow.
     *  A is empasized.

### Chapter 2: Frames -> Reframes

Frame is how we experiance the world. Think about picture frames, it bounds how you percieve (and thus experiance and react to reality)

#### Outcome frame instead of Problem frame:
    * Outcome frame
        * What do I want?
        * How do I get it?
        * What resources are available?

    * Problem Frame:
        * What is wrong?
        * Why is that a problem?
        * What caused it?
        * Whose fault is it?

    *   Not I have a problem, but I want this outcome.
    *   See how much more powerful and action oriented that is.

#### Change frame size
#### Context Reframing
#### Content Reframing
#### Reframe Critics and Criticism
#### Pattern: Intention and Redefining
#### Pattern: Intention and Redefining
#### Oneword reframing exercise
#### Percieve from different model of world, by taking a second position

Models of the world - Seek first to understand. Three perspectives
* My frame/model
* Other persons frame/model
* Objective observers model.
