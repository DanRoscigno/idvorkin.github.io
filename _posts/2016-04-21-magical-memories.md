Being a dealer of smiles and wonder is a priority in my life, and magic is my instrument. This post details my history and some highlights

### Early magic memories

* Never really saw magic as a kid, but love to be "amazed". At a french bistro in Fremont, there was a roving magician. His finally was card to ceiling. Looked up and saw cards all over the ceiling.
* At the table when Hanninbal did [Roadhouse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1iaCcL9UDw) and his perfect classic force.


### How I started:

* Carl Bystrom's class at magic with a french drop jacket routine (great intro Carl - thanks!)
* Not knowing how to shuffle and thus having to learn to shuffle till my fingers bled.
* Meeting the emerald city wizards, and the first night with professional magicians.
* Meeting Felix, and then Jarrod.
* Meeting Clive


### Magic Get Togethers

* First Magic Conference - 3 of clubs
* Second Magic Conference - MagiFest


### Highlights:

- Doing card to ceiling and the card still being on the ceiling at Microsoft a year later
- Girl on the bus that loved my magic trick.
- Girl at ice cream store who loved the trick, and jump up and down in a circle cuz it was so awesome.
- Failure at park where 10 yera old told me I got in wrong, but in fact I had done it correctly.
- Ben's son who carried the card around in his back pack for years.
- Card to blouse for intern
