Being a dealer of smiles and wonder is a priority in my life, and magic is my instrument. This post details my history and some highlights

### Early magic memories

- Never really saw magic as a kid, but love to be "amazed". At a french bistro in Fremont, there was a roving magician. His finally was card to ceiling. Looked up and saw cards all over the ceiling.
- At the table when Hannibal did [Roadhouse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1iaCcL9UDw) and his perfect classic force.

### How I started

- Carl Bystrom's class at magic with a french drop jacket routine (great intro Carl - thanks!)
- Not knowing how to shuffle and thus having to learn to shuffle till my fingers bled.
- Meeting the emerald city wizards, and the first night with professional magicians.
- Meeting Felix, and then Jarrod.
- Meeting Clive

### Magic Get Together

- First Magic Conference - 3 of clubs
- Second Magic Conference - MagiFest

### Highlights

- Card to ceiling and the card:
  - Still being on the ceiling at Microsoft a year later, someone asked, Hey Taft, why is your name on that card stuck to the ceiling
  - Still being on the ceiling at the gym locker room
- Girl on the bus that loved my magic trick.
- Girl at ice cream store who loved the trick, and jump up and down in a circle because it was so awesome.
- Failure at park where 10 year old told me I got in wrong, but in fact I had done it correctly.
- Ben's son who carried the card around in his back pack for years.
- Card to blouse for intern
- Card across where thought I messed up with audience, but card stuck to guys ass
- Giving out unicorn coins
- Performing at Pike Place

#### People keeping the cards and coins

This young man kept this coin for over 18 months, through a pandemic and through a move sequence of Seattle, to Boston to Amsterdam. That's magic.

{%include blob_image.html src="magic/2_year_old_unicorn.jpeg" %}

Did a magic trick for a kid, kid kept the card in his back pack for a year, and always showed it to folks.

Anniversary card, a waitress saw me and some magicians at the bar, and said, 20 years ago, a magician did this trick, and I've carried this card in my wallet ever since.

#### Bar Magic

Usually I just get to watch Clive perform, but I'll get my own videos here eventually:

#### School magic

Amelia's always proud I do magic. I was at her Kindergarden party, and suddenly they let the kids out and I was surrounded by 15 Kindergardeners who wanted to see magic. It was awesome! I did tricks for lots to them, had them write their names on cards, gave out rubber bands -- was a wonderful experience.

#### Interview magic

- Best ever - Interviewer was WFH over video.
  - Daughter crawls in, Mom tries to shew her away.
  - I say, stop, watch.
  - Daughter stands up, only mouth and nose in frame.
  - I get up and back palm.
  - Jaw drops.
  - Hard to beat that
- Guy doing Full-CD said snap your fingers find the bug
- Recruiters - Dream candidate and linked in
- Good candidate - Dream Job
- TODO something with distraction, or setup card to ceiling

#### That's the coolest guy ever

One day I was walking downtown and ran into Colin and his kids. I love doing magic, so without introducing myself, I kneeled down and did magic for the kids and wandered off saying nothing else. I'm sure I enjoyed the moment, but didn't think hard about it.

A few years later as I chatted with Colin, he brought that interaction up, and told me his daughter's reaction after I'd continued on my way. His daughter said - "Wow, who was that?", Colin answered - "My friend Igor". His daughter cocked her head and continued "Wow your friend is the coolest guy in the world".

I'm confident Colin exaggerated to make me feel good, but I'll take his story at face value as it certainly makes me feel great and re-focus on my magic practice.

#### Family Magic

Amelia - Amelia starting to do brave reverse with card turning over.

Zach - Making up his own card trick for woman waiting on the bus. -

#### Freedom

One of my magic routines is "pick a card, write down what you really want on it".
Then the card is lost and the person says their magic word several times to find the thing they want. We do this a few times re-enforcing they can get the thing they want.
When the trick is over I say OK, this card with the thing you want is for you. Remember, you can always do that when you're having trouble getting what you want.

My wrist had been bugging me and so I hadn't been doing magic for a few months, and had sort of lost the habit. I saw a woman that looked like she could use some joy, so I did the above magic. She wrote down that she wanted freedom. I was a bit disappointed, I like it when folks write something personal, and I assumed she was writing this for some political purpose.

After we did the magic the woman seemed really happy, and said "I really needed that - thank you"!

A few days later I saw the woman again, and she stopped me and said "Wow, that magic really was life changing thank you". I figured she was lying and just being kind, and said "glad you enjoyed it", and went on my way. But after that, I spent a bunch more time practicing magic.

That small encouragement was enough though, and I restarted my daily magic. A few days later I saw the woman again and thanked her - "When you told me the magic mattered to you, it made my day and inspired me to double down into magic". She was like, "oh it was mutually beneficial then". She went on to explain that on the day I did the magic she'd been served divorce papers, and it was crushing. She said "When I took that card, I was literally given my freedom".

Wow!

### Training

### Philosphical Questions

#### Wonder vs Joy vs Meaning vs Reactions

#### Manipulation vs Augmenting Experiences

Many techniques in magic are around managing attention and molding the experience. You could look at these as manipulative. The test for manipulation vs augmenting experiences, is the intent. If the intent is personal gain it's manipulative, if the intent is the experience of the spectator it's master.

#### Imbalance of Impact

_Cross file this in my post on joy_

Often the impact of magic (or Joy) can be intense, especially relative to the act.

I need more thinking here but something like.

- Measure happiness in Moodles (Mu) see discussion in [happy](/happy).
- People have a happiness set point (SP) So
  - Default Happiness = SP
- Doing something wonder/joy isn't additive, it pushes someone to just above their SP, say SP+K.
  - Before - Happiness = Z
  - After - Happiness = SP+K
- If the person is already close their set point, they don't move their happiness much e.g:
  - Before - Happiness = SP
  - After - Happiness = SP+K
  - Delta Happy = (SP+K) - SP) = K
- If the person is depressed, say half their set point, then the impact is huge:
  - Before - Happiness = SP/2
  - After - Happiness = SP+K
  - Delta Happy = (SP+K) - (SP/2) = SP/2+K (!!!!)

### Favorite Acts

#### Lennart Green - Superb Card Handling

{% include youtube.html src="1_oa8m5Oq00?start=17" %}

#### Brian Gillis - Top shelf Sleight of Hand

{% include youtube.html src="7tUaBtHd-dA?start=11" %}

#### Hannibal

I like lots of his stuff. Roadhouse is racy, but fantastic. Elph boots is great, and so is this poem

{% include youtube.html src="002oterS2Wg" %}

- Carl: How do you fix it? You fix it by doing it right!
- Carl: Stop - practice does not make perfect. It makes permanent.
- Carl: That's great, except for the part you're flailing.
- Felix: Uhm, that's OK, just practice another 9,997 times.
- Felix, Oh, are you new at magic, maybe try a double lift.
- Hannibal: Faiure is not an option, it's a requirement. Failure is not a person, it's an event
