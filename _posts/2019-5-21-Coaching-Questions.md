Coaching is not giving advice, it's helping others solve their own problems. Use the following questions and approaches to help folks find their own solutions and insights.

### Coaching Mindset

Coaching is a mindset and inner discipline. While coaching try to do the following

- Ask permission to be a coach.
- Check-in with your inner self to make sure you're maintaining the coaching mindset
- Let your coachee speak their piece. (Avoid cutting them off)
- Keep questions open ended. (Avoid Yes/No questions)
- Be accepting (do not judge)
- Test your understanding (do not assume you understand)
- Be compassionate and curious (do not judge the coachee or think they are wrong)

### Special Coaching Situations

Some coaching situations are common, so I have deep dived into them.

- [Making Major Decisions](/decisive) - A deep dive on how to improve high impact decision making.
- [Dealing with Pride](/fuck-pride) - A deep dive on dealing with pride.
- [Job Hunting](job-hunt-stress) - A deep dive on job changes

### 7 questions to start your coaching

When folks come to you questions or are stuck, that's a great time to provide rapid in the moment coaching. The 7 questions are a great starting point to help coachee build the required insights for coaching:

- Open: What's on your mind?
- Expand: What Else?
- Focus Problem: What's the real challenge here for you?
- Focus Need: What do you want?
  - Do not ask why, it makes people defensive - you're question their ability by asking why.
  - Want vs Need
- Focus Request: How can I help?
- Focus Trade off: If you say yes to this, what will you have to say no to?
  - Omission - automatic no
  - Commission - what you must deliberately give up to make it happen (relationships/projects/)
- Close the loop: What was most useful for you in this conversation?

#### How to coach for task completion vs insight

Coaching applies to different time frames, keep them separate:

- P: Project - Immediate task
- P: People - Relationship
- PC: Pattern - Help person get better.

#### How to coach to build strategic insight

- What does success mean?
- What is our scope (who/where)
- What will be our differentiator/moat here?
- What capabilities/assets will need to achieve this?
- How do we measure success and provide feedback?

#### How to keep people safe while coaching using human safety models

TERA -

- **Tribe:** Tribe, 'us' vs 'them' - be us.
- **Certainty:** People dislike ambiguity/uncertainty.
- **Rank:** Do I move up or down the social ladder
- **Autonomy:** I have control

SCARF -
_More details in [Search inside yourself - Leadership and social skills](/search-inside-yourself)_

- **Status:** Where am I in the pecking order
  - **BUILD:** Give credit, and feedback, ups peoples status
- **Certainty:** Do I know what what's going on.
  - **Build:** removing ambiguity, and giving people certainty on things that matter.
- **Autonomy:** Do I have control over the situation?
  - **Build:** making clear it's people's choice, not yours.
- **Relatedness:** Is other person friend or foe.
  - **Build:** by taking time to know people.
- **Fairness:**
  - **Build:** making clear that you're being fair.

#### Soften your coaching: How Can I help

- Out of curiosity
- Just so I know
- To help my understand better
- To make sure I'm clear
- That is a hard problem
- Not alone, lots of people struggle with this.

SCARF Model:
_Fairness_ People will injure themselves to ensure fairness.

#### Deflecting the desire for you to solve their problem: How would you handle this

Great question, I have some ideas, but first, how would you tackle this? What else?

#### Saying No: Say yes slowly

- Why are you asking me?
- Whom else have you asked?
- What you say urgent what do you mean?
- What does done mean?
- If I could only do one part, what part would you have me do?
- What do you recommend I take off my plate to get this done?want done?
- _If you still have to say no_ Make sure you're saying no to task, no to person.

### Focus feedback on "you", not them.

From the superb HBR article: [The feedback fallacy](https://hbr.org/2019/03/the-feedback-fallacy). If you don't read the article (which I'll also summarize)
take this high order bit of focusing the feedback on "you" not on them. E.g. feedback should be "I expereinced X", instead of you screwed up X.

| Easy way                                               | Effective Way                                                                                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Can I give you some feedback?                          | Here’s my reaction                                                                                                |
| Good job!                                              | Here are three things that really worked for me. What was going through your mind when you did them?              |
| Here’s what you should do.                             | Here’s what I would do.                                                                                           |
| Here’s where you need to improve                       | Here’s what worked best for me, and here’s why                                                                    |
| That didn’t really work.                               | When you did x, I felt y or I didn’t get that.                                                                    |
| You need to improve your communication skills.         | Here’s exactly where you started to lose me.                                                                      |
| You need to be more responsive.                        | When I don’t hear from you, I worry that we’re not on the same page.                                              |
| You lack strategic thinking.                           | I’m struggling to understand your plan.                                                                           |
| You should do x [in response to a request for advice]. | What do you feel you’re struggling with, and what have you done in the past that’s worked in a similar situation? |

### Situational coaching

As people learn new skills they experience a learning curve, which requires different support at different points on the curve. [Situational leadership](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situational_leadership_theory) describes this in detail, but in a nutshell, while learning new things, people go through this grid from 1 to 4.

| Competent/Confident | Confident                                                   | Scared                                                          |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Incompetent         | 1. Foolish Novice - Thinks they can do it, but really can't | 2. Novice - Knows they can't do it, and feels bad               |
| Competent           | 4. Expert - Know they can do it, and they're right          | 3. Journey man - Thinks they can't do it, but actually they can |

In each of these stages different support is required.

| Competent/Confident | Confident                                                   | Scared                                                                                  |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Incompetent         | 1. Directive - Prescriptive; lots of monitoring             | 2. Coaching - Half prescriptive, Explain reasoning, lots of checkin to answer questions |
| Competent           | 4. Delegate - Give them the success criteria let them drive | 3. Support - Descriptive, help them tune, occasional check in                           |

### Other coaching tools

- Using a scale question for relative improvement not for calibration. E.g. on a scale of 1 to 10, how do you rank yourself on X! Great, why do you say that?, Great - what would you need to do to move up a point on the scale?

- Imagery cards - Use cards with images on them to illicit from people what picture represents what concept, then have a discussion. E.g. which of these pictures represents leadership to you? OK, help me see how that shows a leader to you.
