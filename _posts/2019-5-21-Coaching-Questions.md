Coaching is not giving advice, it's helping others solve their own problems. Use the following questions and approaches to help folks find their own solutions and insights.

#### Ask these 7 questions to coach

- Open: What's on your mind?
- Expand: What Else?
- Focus Problem: What's the real challenge here for you?
- Focus Need: What do you want?
  - Do not ask why, it makes people defensive - you're question their ability by asking why.
  - Want vs Need
- Focus Request: How can I help?
- Focus Trade off: If you say yes to this, what will you have to say no to?
  - Omission - automatic no
  - Commission - what you must deliberately give up to make it happen (relationships/projects/)
- Close the loop: What was most useful for you in this conversation?

#### How to coaching for task completion vs insight

- P: Project - Immediate task
- P: People - Relationship
- PC: Pattern - Help person get better.

#### How to coach to build strategic insight

- What does success mean?
- What is our scope (who/where)
- What will be our differentiator/moat here?
- What capabilities/assets will need to achieve this?
- How do we measure success and provide feedback?

#### How to keep people safe while coaching using human safety models

TERA -

- **Tribe:** Tribe, 'us' vs 'them' - be us.
- **Certainty:** People dislike ambiguity/uncertainty.
- **Rank:** Do I move up or down the social ladder
- **Autonomy:** I have control

SCARF -
_More details in [Search inside yourself - Leadership and social skills](/search-inside-yourself)_

- **Status:** Where am I in the pecking order
  - **BUILD:** Give credit, and feedback, ups peoples status
- **Certainty:** Do I know what what's going on.
  - **Build:** removing ambiguity, and giving people certainty on things that matter.
- **Autonomy:** Do I have control over the situation?
  - **Build:** making clear it's people's choice, not yours.
- **Relatedness:** Is other person friend or foe.
  - **Build:** by taking time to know people.
- **Fairness:**
  - **Build:** making clear that you're being fair.

#### Soften your coaching: How Can I help

- Out of curiosity
- Just so I know
- To help my understand better
- To make sure I'm clear

SCARF Model:
_Fairness_ People will injure themselves to ensure fairness.

#### Deflecting the desire for you to solve their problem: How would you handle this

Great question, I have some ideas, but first, how would you tackle this? What else?

#### Saying No: Say yes slowly

- Why are you asking me?
- Whom else have you asked?
- What you say urgent what do you mean?
- What does done mean?
- If I could only do one part, what part would you have me do?
- What do you recommend I take off my plate to get this done?want done?
  _If you still have to say no_ Make sure you're saying no to task, no to person. Just writing it down will help.\*
