Wearing a silly hat, his trusty folding bike at his feet, and using a purple fountain pen, Igor "Began with the end in mind" with the "important but not urgent" task of penning this eulogy, likely starting at 5am.   Igor wanted this life, so he wrote it, he reviewed it, he lived it, and he worked with his family, friends, and multitude of mentors, to adjust and tweak it.

_Currenty the purpose of my eulogy is to guide me in living my life. As death gets closer, the purpose of this eulogy will transform into enteraining others at my funeral_

_For many of my roles, I'm still figuring out who I want to be, and how I will achieved it, so this list is not yet in priority order. The fleshed out sections are the easy ones to write, because, well, they are the easy ones to write :)_

### As an entertainer

Juggling fire, making cards change colors at a spectators command, or passing coins through a spectator's hand -- Igor lived to see eyes go wide and mouths gape with wonderment.  Igor especially loved it when strangers got drawn in against their inner objections, or when a kid having a meltdown, or a grown up looking miserable, had their frown turned upside down.

### As an alternate transportation advocate

Igor took a strange pleasure in not driving. Riding his folding bike, or making a long day of public transit with Zach and Amelia. Igor would take the kids on the bus, to the train, to the airport, to ride the airport elevators, just to reverse the process and head home so he could enjoy his kids, and the bus, without spending a dime.

Igor loved living in the city so he could walk Zach and Amelia to their school and local library. Igor also loved the subway station 10 minutes from his home, which when combined with his folding bicycle let him get anywhere in the city car free.

Igor was especially fond of his folding bicycle which let him look goofy, be incredibly practical, and carry around the things he loved.  Nothing made Igor happier then having the kids on the folding bike.

### As a physical healthy human

Igor knew physical health was the [source of his energy](https://medium.com/being-healthy/physical-health-a2f648e7574c#.g30t2werl) and acted accordingly. Every month Igor pledged his weight would be 140lbs, and he put [1000$ on the line](http://ighealth.blogspot.com/2014/10/the-best-1000-i-did-spend.html) to make sure he never renegged on his pledge. Igor valued his cardio vascular endurance and tried to run a fast 4 miles 2 to 3 times a week. Igor also tried to incorporate biking into his life whenever possible: biking to work, biking to doctors appointments, and even biking the grocery store (which was not efficient nor effective, but enjoyable). Finally, Igor knew the importance of sleep, and always woke up @ 5am. When Igor was having trouble getting enough sleep, he'd cut his caffiene to make sure his body forced him to get the sleep he needed. 

It took Igor almost 40 years to get his weight under control sustainably. At his most unhealthy, [Igor weighted 230 lbs](https://www.flickr.com/photos/idvorkin/4590579760/in/datetaken/), and felt terrible. Luckily Igor's good friend recommended [Fat sick and nearly dead](http://ighealth.blogspot.com/search?q=fat+sick+and+nearly+dead) and Igor began [juice fasting](http://ighealth.blogspot.com/search/label/juicing) the next day.

Igor was incredibly grateful to his friend Ammon for teaching him about the weight pledge, and for being a weight pledge partner for over 30 years.

### As an emotionally healhty human

Igor understood emotional health is the basis of his stability, and invested accordingly. Igor started each day at 5am by recording his blessing in his gratefulness journal, followed by 20 minutes of meditation. Igor closed the day in a similar vein, a final 20 minutes of meditation and writing out what made the day great in his gratefulness journal. 

Igor prided himself in being able to ride his

## Roles I haven't started writing yet

tbd

### Disciplined, Deliberate, Daily

Discipline is hard. Frequently Igor's discipline started strong at the beginning of the day/week/month but he'd fall of the wagon.  Igor realized that was OK, and started his discipline again the next day. This embodied grandmother mind and being compassionate.

### As someone with cognative health

tbd

### As a worker

tbd

### As someone who made others happy through pleasure, flow and purpose.

* How he treated homeless and strangers in passing

### As a coder/technologist

* Igor believed the perfect programmer was Anal retentive and lazy. While Igor was a 10/10 on lazy, he was only a 1/10 for being Anal. As a result, he relied heavily on automated tests, and very little on human process.
* To empower his laziness Igor focused on tools that are easy to read, mutate and have excellent libraries. Python, and C# being some of his favorites.
* Igor is a huge beleive in static typing, especially implict static typing.
* Today, these have become the industry norms, which is great for Igor, because he can stop arguing about it.
* Igor loved VIM, using it in as many programs as he could. Interestingly, as his career progressed he was able to use vim key bindings in every tool he used.
* Igor's coding principles - No duplicate code; Trust tests not experts; Log Bug then Whine;
* Igor tried to develop in such a way that you could bottom up a design via excellent refactoring of implementation.
* Igor read books on other languages just to see what better implementation patterns looked like.


## Igor's helper section

### Writing Prompts

* For each - split by common vs unique w/others:
* How do I know when done this section
* What am I most proud of

* What activities give me the most pleasure
