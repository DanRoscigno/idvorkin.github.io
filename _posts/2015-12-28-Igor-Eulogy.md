Wearing a silly hat, his trusty folding bike at his side, and using a purple fountain pen, Igor "Began with the end in mind" with the "important but not urgent" penning this eulogy at 5am.   Igor wanted this life, so wrote it, reviewed it, lived it, rinsed and repeated, with his family, friends, and multitude of mentors. 

_Currenty this post is optimized to guide me in living my life. As I'm closer to death, it's puprose will transform into enteraining others at my funeral, via more 'show don't tell'._ 

_For many of my roles I'm still figuring out who I want to be, and how I achieved it, so this list is not yet in priority order. The fleshed out sections are the easy ones to write, because, well, they are the easy ones to write :)_ 

### As an entertainer

Juggling Fire, making cards change colors in front of people's eyes, or passing coins through people's hands -- Igor lived to see strangers eye's go wide with wonder.  Igor especially loved it when people couldn't stop themselves from being draw in, or when he could turn around someone's day - a kid having a meltdown, a grown up looking miserable.

### As a biker, bus rider, and general alternate transportation nut.

Igor took a strange pleasure in not driving. Riding his folding bike, or making a long day of public transit quality time with Zach and Amelia. Igor would take the kids on the bus, to the train, to the airport, to ride the airport elevators, just to reverse the process and head home so he could enjoy his kids, and the bus, without spending a dime.

Igor loved living in the city so he could walk Zach and Amelia to their school and local library. Igor also loved the subway station 10 minutes from his home, which when combined with his folding bicycle let him get anywhere in the city car free.

Igor was especially fond of his folding bicycle which let him look goofy, be incredibly practical, and carry around the things he loved.  Nothing made Igor happier then having the kids on the folding bike.
