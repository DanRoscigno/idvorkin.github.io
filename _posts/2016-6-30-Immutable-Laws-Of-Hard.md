Exercise, Diet, Personal Development, each of these is governed by the immutable laws of hard things. It's possible these laws don't apply to you, but I doubt it.

Law #1: Without a goal and a measure, you will move farther and farther away from your desired state.

Law #2: Regardess of what you predict, you'll never 'beat your goal'. Instead, you'll only barely achieve it.

Law #3: Without a consequence, and/or a strong reward, you'll ignore your goal.
