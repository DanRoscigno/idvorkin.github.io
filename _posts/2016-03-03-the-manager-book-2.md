Managing is hard. Lessons are hard earned and should be cherished. This post is designed to make explicit, and improve behaviors and practices. It reminds us how to behave, and encourages continuous improvement.

This post uses the word manager, but the majority of topics are applicable to all software job functions regardless of seniority or the number of direct reports, zero direct reports included.

## What does a manager do

<a id="l-what-managers-do"></a>

### What are a managers responsibilities

### How do you measure their success

### What is a manager accountable for

The success of a manager is the success of the team. This manifest in 4 dimensions:

<!--
An acid test:

- People love their team.
- People have clear understanding of career growth/progression and how their work supports it.
-->

| Dimension                          | Success Means                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Business Results                   | Team delivers business value for our customers and organization. I define success (KPI), and help team understand and deliver it.                                                                                                                 |
| High performance people and teams  | Team is well gelled and team members help each other. Everyone has growth plans which fit their needs and they are executing them.                                                                                                                |
| Engineering Efficiency and Process | Engineering systems and protocols ensure a pit of success. Process is automated, and releases have high velocity and minimal risk.                                                                                                                |
| Technical Assets                   | Systems are extensible in the ways that support the business. Operational burden is minimal (side bar: to help me prioritize I'm on the pages), and technical debt is applied judiciously (take debt if you might be able to write off the asset) |

### How do you describe your job to people outside the industry

I run a factory which produces widgets and has employees. For those in the industry this translates to:

| Dimension                          | Analog               | Metrics and Measures | Success Means                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Business Results                   | Produced Widgets     | [l20](l20)           | I work with the business to help figure out the best "widgets we can make", by understanding what people want to buy, and explaining how our factory runs.                            |
| High performance people and teams  | Factory Workers      | [l21](l21)           | Workers in the factory are healthy, learning, want to come to work every day, and getting along with co-workers.                                                                      |
| Engineering Efficiency and Process | Operating procedures | [l22](l22)           | The factory is efficient: Production good and improving. Widgets comes out consistently and on schedule? New employees know what to do. Everyone knows what to do during emergencies? |
| Technical Assets                   | Factory machines     | [l23](l23)           | Machines in the factory adjusted quickly for the different types of widgets we build. Machines require minimal maintenance and have high efficiency                                   |

<div> </div>

- l20

- Recommend joining the factory to their friends
- Work at the factory for several years

<div> </div>

- l22
- Workers are efficient and safe with minimal effort
- Mistakes are learned once, and never repeated?
- Continuous improvement is occurring
- Variance is low
- Over time work is not required

<div> </div>

- l23
- Support a wide range of widgets
- Can be extended to build new widgets at low cost
- Have have availability
- Operate at low cost

### Hardest part about being a manager

- Firing: People think it's firing but it's not, see that section
- Personally: Telling team I'm quitting, tears, ride bike, etc.
- Actual: When need to surprise folks, abrupt direction change or killing projects.
- Likely, but I haven't done it: Layoffs, when know and can't tell.

### What do you do in the first 90 days

First 90 days is [the bible here](/90days)

Outputs:

- Early Win: Figure out the situation, and deliver a win.
- Trust: Relationships with team, and peers, and partners.
- Knowledge: Know critical parts of business, tech, org.

### What do managers do all day

<a id="l-what-managers-schedule"></a>

\_For non-managers, recall a manager's purpose is supporting others, not making stuff. As a result they have a [manager schedule, not a maker schedule](http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html).

In a typical 44 hours week, 24 hours are standing commitments with others, and 20 hours vary based on the time of year, and needs of the team, business, and partners. Vivek Garg has a good post on his [manager of manager's calendar if you want more insights](https://istn.substack.com/p/rush-hour-go-inside-the-calendar).

| Hours | Time Allocation                                              |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 20    | Variable Time - depends on season and team need              |
| 8     | Team 1:1s - See the [1:1 questions](#l-one-on-one)           |
| 6     | Partner 1:1s - PM, Design, Partner EMs, Other Developers     |
| 6     | Reviews - Project, Engineering, Staff, Initiative            |
| 4     | Recruiting/Networking - Coffee chats, sell calls, interviews |

Depending on time of year, and experience of my team and partners, I'm doing 1 or 2 of the following with my discretionary time:

**People Development:**

- Stack Ranking/Performance Reviews/Career Growth Plans
- Low performers
- Complex people situations (more often then you'd expect)
- Extra recruiting

**Product:**

- Strategy development
- Road mapping
- Pitching
- Data Analysis

**Execution**

- Escalations
- Unblocking the team
- Negotiating/Finding win/wins with other teams
- Re-balancing projects and engineer allocation
- Inter and Intra team conflict.

**Tech/Organization**

- Generating content for a talk/program (e.g. D&I, Recruiting, People Development)
- Architecture/Design/Engineering Excellence brainstorming, and review
- RCA Analysis

### Should managers be technical

Yes they are ultimately responsible for the outcomes of the team and that requires them to understand, confirm and nudge the team and partners. They should ensure the team is making correct architectural decisions and engineering excellence improves due to best practices.

They need to represent the team in technical forums, swag costs, represent laws of physics, bring back best practices, and catch upcoming incompatibilities and challenges.

- Attend architecture and design reviews
- Be on every page the team gets
- Have strong relationships w/technical leaders like principal engineers
- Follow major tech trends and product launches (keynotes, major tech blog posts)
- Read seminal books on topics ([ML](/td/machine-learning), [Cloud Native Apps](/td/cloud-first-applications), [Data Systems](td/data-systems), [etc](/td))
- Have Side projects in assorted tech and ideas (ML, PWA, FaaS)

They also need to be experts at working with data systems and analysis, as much of their time will be analyzing customer, business, operational, and technical data.

Once developers become managers they have little time to use their technical muscle, and their technical Aptitude declines due to lack of use. Therefore I recommend before switching they are:

- A very experienced engineer (MSFT L65, AMZN L6, FB E6).
- A expert in at multiple languages (for me python, and C#)
- An expert in multiple technical domains (for me networking and security).

### Should managers code

Managers should read code on specific occasions, but they can't be on critical path because their time is often needed to deal with urgent situations. Thus, they can only write low importance code usually something you'd assign to an SDE-I. At that point, you have a very expensive priority inversion.

That said, SDMs need to use their product just like their customers do to be able to better understand and meet the customer need. Likewise, SDMs need to use their development tools periodically, which should include the code/test/deploy cycle, so they are better able to understand and meet their team's (aka other big customer) need.

SDMs should be reading code occasionally:

1. Spot checking - SDMs should have a good "something is fishy" intuition, and should be able to independently and discreetly prove or disprove their intuition.
1. Assessing people - Code is a major deliverable for developers and should be inspected as part of people assessment.
1. Deep dive during major outages - In high risk, time critical situations like outages, you want your best people reviewing the changes, and this includes SDMs. If an SDM can't understand a high risk time sensitive code change, it can be, and should be simplified.

### What engineering efficiency metrics should a manager monitor?

Lots, but these 3 are probably high on the list:

1. How much time is spent in outages/livesite/maintenance (don't forget to include time that should be but isn't due to lack of monitoring).
2. How often can developers check in?
3. How long does it take for a change to get to production.

## Managing and Developing People

### How do you coach

Coaching is a major part of the job, and covered in my [coaching post](/coaching):

_Coaching is like midwifery. A midwife can not give birth to the baby, she facilitates the birth. Similarly, a coach can not give a solution, she must give birth to the insight from within the coachee. Coaching is asking questions, guiding, and facilitating understanding, and this post collects my studies on the topic._

### What mechanisms do you have to ensure career development

**Principles for career development**

- Peeps have an accurate, clear understanding of their interests, strengths, weakness, and next career steps.
- Peeps have a clear understanding of level and role expectations for the current and next career stage.
- Peeps understand how their work "ladders up" in impact and career development.
- Peeps get frequent feedback on in progress work
- Peeps and managers have a consistent understanding of the above.
- Manager actually uses the process himself with her own manager.

To achieve these principles there are several tools:

| Tool                      | Time Horizon    | Checkin Frequency |
| ------------------------- | --------------- | ----------------- |
| Career Growth Plan        | 6m to 2y        | 3m                |
| Pre Write Self Assessment | 1m to 6m        | 4w to 8w          |
| Frequent Feedback         | Immediate       | As Needed         |
| Situational Leadership    | Stage Dependant | Stage Dependant   |

### How do you support folks with their career growth plans (CGPs)

CGPs are Forward looking and a good place to discuss what opportunities are required, and what major development areas should be tackled, and what's required to meet the next career level. [I.M.Wright gives some excellent insights](https://imwrightshardcode.com/2021/11/whats-your-career-plan/)

Each employee has a career growth plan (CGP). This is a document with open ended questions like:

- What are you most proud of?
- What is most draining?
- What are your short, medium and long term career goals?
- What are the steps to get there?
- What are your gaps between now and the next step?

To help with the last two questions, this document has the list of expectations for the current level, and next level. For each expectation, you fill in your self assessment of where you are at on the expectations relative to level, sometimes it's below, at or above. This is great tool to ensure you and those supporting you are in sync, and that they can best support you.

### How do you support folks by pre-writing self assessments

Think through what will be delivered in the next 1-6 months, and how it will be delivered.

Most companies have a performance program - At MSFT it's connects, at FB it's PSCs and Amazon it's Forte. As part of this process, and employee writes a self assessment for the work that happened in the last 6 months - 1 year, and then the manager uses that as a basis of the review they'll write.

There are several advantages to pre-writing these documents:

- The peep and manager can be deliberate about what work is done, and discuss if projects make sense.
- The peep and manager understand the impact provided by the work.
- The peep has a record of what they've done in the performance period, instead of only having a crisp memory of the last few months.
- The manager can calibrate the work to be done so there are no scope surprises.

Good self assessments are concise, focuses on impact, and then how you delivered the impact. More details at [I.M Wright](https://imwrightshardcode.com/2018/06/connects-with-impact/):

- _[Clearly measurable impact]_ by _[work you’ve done yourself and/or with others]._
  - Relevant artifacts, or quote from others validating the claim.

Here are some fictitious examples modelled on my own career:

- Improved Azure virtual machine boot time from 12 minutes to 2 minutes at P90 by investigating end to end system behavior, understanding end 2 end system operation, creating and driving agreement to all up goal, and then working with teams to estabilish budgets, and holding them accountable to delivering them.

  - > At first my team was skeptical that the performance improvements could be achieved and were hesitant to invest, but once we saw the organizational support and monthly meetings of progress we found it inspiring and made sure we contributed to the goal.

- Drove XXX\$ to charities, and increased Alexa Shopping DAU XXX % (XXX to YYY) to by proposing a charity giving feature and implementing it in 5 months. Complexity, 20 eng/months, supporting work from 5 teams, across multiple divisions

- Delivered XYZ, required to deliver TLS support on windows phone at very high quality. Complexity 1 engineer, 4 months - however requried ramping up on complex error prone C++ code base, and no bugs found

  - > Igor's delivery was on time and of high quality. The feature had no bugs in production, due to high test coverage, which was impressive given the high complexity of the C++ code.

- Increased team morale and cross group collaboration by proposing weekly team lunches, and monthly lunches with the broader organization.
  - The monthly lunches were great. At one of them, I learned Bob on the other team was building a similar feature to mine and so we collaborated and were able to save 3 weeks of coding time.

You should be observing the key to these self assessments is impact. The goal isn't motion, it's impact. If you don't know the impact, you should ask yourself (and your manager) why you are doing the work. Pre-writing self assessments is a great way to do this.

### How do you give fast, frequent, feedback

I aspire to provide immediate observed feedback, for something that is about to happen (like reviewing a document), or a de-brief after a critical meeting or review.

I keep my eyes open for opportunities for feedback from my observations, and from soliciting feedback from peers and partners. I take the feedback and figure out the best way to give it.

My priority is "catching employees doing something right", so I can re-enforce positive behavior. Even better, with positive behaviors I can provide them in public which not only benefits the employee, but also re-enforces that goodness with the team.

### How do you think about situational leadership

More details are in my [coaching post](/coaching). Here's a preview:

As people learn new skills they experience a learning curve, which requires different support at different points on the curve. [Situational leadership](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situational_leadership_theory) describes this in detail, but in a nutshell, while learning new things, people go through this grid from 1 to 4.

| Competent/Confident | Confident                                                   | Scared                                                          |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Incompetent         | 1. Foolish Novice - Thinks they can do it, but really can't | 2. Novice - Knows they can't do it, and feels bad               |
| Competent           | 4. Expert - Know they can do it, and they're right          | 3. Journey man - Thinks they can't do it, but actually they can |

In each of these stages different support is required.

| Competent/Confident | Confident                                      | Scared                                          |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Incompetent         | 1. Instruct and Explain - Tell them what to do | 2. Guide and Encourage - Show them how to do it |
| Competent           | 4. Empower - Explain Why Not                   | 3. Facilitate - Explain Why.                    |

### What is the level specific career expectations and growth strategies

Depends on the skill level (E.g. [levels](https://www.levels.fyi/) ): SDE-I is a junior developer, SDE-II intermediate, and SDE-III senior and above . Also see my post on the differences between [Tech Lead, Architects and Managers](/software-leadership-roles).

| Level        | Approach                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Junior       | Not a lot of variance. Have a rubric for junior SDE skills and make sure they are getting the opportunity to learn and execute each box. Make sure they have a solid mentor, and opportunity after opportunity to round out their knowledge.                                                                                                                                          |
| Intermediate | Now it's about how are you helping the team, growing your contributions. Bigger experiences, maybe out side the org, both to build your skills, and increase your org visibility. Double down on super powers, close red flags and blockers. Very satisfying to watch people "blossom" into leaders.                                                                                  |
| Senior/Staff | Here you're getting people that are at a career level and are happy with a lot of what they're doing. Now it's helping folks decide how much they want to grow, and where they want to improve. Here it's finding mentors, and how we want to split responsibility and cover each other. Also opportunities for what they own for the group (30-60+) e.g. security or process or etc. |

My approach, and frequent peep questions.

| Level        | Things I repeat and repeat |
| ------------ | -------------------------- |
| Junior       | [l10](l10)                 |
| Intermediate | [l11](l11)                 |
| Senior/Staff | [l12](l12)                 |

- l10
- We hired you because you're smart+really good. If you can't understand something, it's probably the presenter doesn't understand it well, as opposed to you not understanding.
- You are new, and need to learn and need to spend a bunch of time asking for help and guidance. I have one rule - you must come with a bad idea (which will start becoming good ideas). You fail when you bring nothing, you ace it when you bring a bad idea. We'll help you develop that bad idea, and help sharpen your thinking skill.
- "You have a fresh perspective - If something doesn't make sense ask, for us, we're like fish in water, so challenge our assumptions".
- I'm here to help you close gaps, sharpen their understanding by teaching it to you

<div> </div>

- How do you make the team better?
- What are you gonna be known for?
- You're the owner, you'll do everything and I work for you. What help do you need
- Do shadow coaching, where I might be writing/pr-doing work but they do the send/take the credit

<div> </div>
- l12
- Great post on being a [staff + level engineer](https://lethain.com//staff-plus-eng-resources/)
- Are you clear on [Tech Lead, Architects and Managers](/software-leadership-roles).
- What are you driving for our larger organization?
- How are you maximizing our benefit?
- How do we make sure we compliment each other?

### How do you help people switch jobs

My goal is to find people the right job, not the job on my team. I coach a lot of people through this, and here are my most popular posts:

- [Reducing Job Hunt Stress](/job-hunt-stress)
- [Only care about total compensation](/comp)
- [What I wish I knew at 22](/twentytwo)

### How do you keep people motivated

<a id="l-motivation"></a> <a id="l-motivate"></a>

Classically, motivation is comprised of carrots and sticks, where carrots focus on extrinsic motivation like compensation. Turns out sticks and exterinsic motivations fail for creative tasks. Instead I focus on the following dimensions

Motivation has 2 dimensions, personal experience and team environment. Personal experience is based on the book Drive, and is about encouraging Autonomy, Mastery and Purpose. The team environment is about the culture in which you experience the personal dimension.

Another lens of motivation is [satisfaction and dissatisfaction](/dsat):

_Satisfaction (SAT) is not a lack of dissatisfaction (DSAT). SAT and DSAT are orthogonal experiences. DSAT is the reason you can’t sleep well at night, and SAT is reason you set your alarm for 5am so you can get an early start tackling your favorite problems_

### How to motivate through personal experience

I use Danial Pink's [DRIVE model](https://youtu.be/t9wDmRMtPnA). TL;DR: Extrinsic motivation doesn't work, you need intrinsic motivation, which is driven by Autonomy mastery purpose.

**Autonomy: Direct thy self**

- You choose what you work on (Link: How does resource allocation work)
- You are the end to end owner.
- You make the decisions, though I'm here to support. Even if I disagree, it's your call.
- We collaborate on the definition of success, and then you chose how it gets done.
- I support you in private, by helping you understand success, sharing how I'd do it, helping you see around corners, and bringing up signals and context you may be missing.
- I support you in public by re-inforcing your message and needs, and nudging where nudges are required.
- You know the the team has your back
- I protect you from harmful rays of upper management and business
- Hack-a-thons

**Mastery: Become the best you can be**

- (Link: Managing and developing people)
- I help you brainstorm what skill you want (or need) to master.
- I remind you that building mastery is painful, and that's OK. (Link: Situational Leadership)
- I encourage frequent feedback by encouraging sharing [small increments, spikes, small diffs, etc](https://www.thezbook.com/the-biggest-mistake-i-see-engineers-make-2)
- I encourage continuous improvement, retros, and mentorship and menteeship
- I'll push you to 110% of your capacity, but I tell you when you're at 90,100, or 110.
- As you build your skills, I help you find bigger and bigger opportunities and/or Exposure
- I am on the lookout for projects that help you find what makes sense for you.

**Purpose: Make the world a little bit better**

- Focus on the why
- Call out the impact
- Call out the small wins
- Share the success with the team
- Share success with partners and boss
- Remind you putting the team first, and supporting others is a very strong purpose in and of itself

People also care deeply about coaching and career growth:

- Catching people doing things right.
- 110% of capability but clarify doing 110% vs 80%

### How to motivate through team environment

I focus significant energy nurturing the [team culture](#l-culture):

_As a team we all aspire to a culture where coming to work is fun, the team members put the team needs ahead of their own, the team gelled and by people being vulnerable we built a strong sense of psycholigcal safety_

I spend significant energy generating [Moments](/moments-at-work):

_Of all the places we spend our time, work is the one that dominates. However, when we look back on our lives, work is often the thing we remember least. Why? Because we remember our lives through peak moments, and there are few of those, especially positive peak moments, at work. Luckily, peak moments can be created and leaders can be taught how to create them. This post explores opportunities and techniques to create these moments._

Some moments like:

- Constant celebrating people doing stuff fun
- Hack-a-thons
- Playing cards for appreciation
- Managers making breakfast

### How do you give challenging feedback

Why is feedback challenging?

1. It's a surprise
2. Folks don't want to hear it
3. Folks don't think you have their best interests in mind.

Deep diving on what makes conversations hard:

1. Surprise - see around corners, and bring up anything I see ASAP, and foreshadow. Meet frequently, know what people care about.
2. Attack the messenger - High Trust, Know how and when the person likes to hear stuff. Address what they care about.
3. Don't want to hear it - Self Aware, Think I have their best interest in mind, Put it in terms they want to hear it.
4. Over dramatize - Anticipate what they'll care about, pre-address.

Types of tough conversations to flesh out:

Performance, Charter, Re-org, Team mates leaving, Lay Offs.

### What's the point of 1:1s

<a id="l-one-on-one"></a>

1:1's are the highest ROI activity and the most expensive. They take 100% of both parties attention in a non-scalable manner. At the same time:

- If on average 1:1s gives an 0.25% performance improvement, you get a 12% per performance improvement per year, which equates to 300% in ten years.
- If there isn't a forum for discussion, many concerns and bottlenecks will be ignored. Those ignored concerns and bottlenecks are lost opportunities in the best case, inefficiency in the median case, and catastrophe in the worst case. (Using an exception handler analogy, the default exception handler is ignore all, and we know how that works out)

My goal for 1:1's is to:

- Build trust and relationships
- [Coach and be coached strategically and tactically](/coaching)
- Teach and Learn context
- Have confidential, [awkward discussions](https://medium.com/@mrabkin/the-art-of-the-awkward-1-1-f4e1dcbd1c5c) ([part 2](https://medium.com/@mrabkin/the-art-of-the-awkward-1-1-f4e1dcbd1c5c))
- Allow others to express emotions and let off steam in a safe space

(Again with that programming analogy, the 1:1 is a debugger attached catch all exception handler. This allow all concerns to be discussed, understood, rethrown, reprogrammed or ignored. I know - the analogy needs work, help me make it better)

### What do you do in 1:1s

My favorite opening is "What's on your mind", then I focus on asking ([coaching questions](/coaching)) and end with "what can I do immediately to help you?"

I push for awkward conversations. When my peeps have nothing to talk about I ask some of my [favorite prompts](/prompts)
A few things I don't do:

- **No public status reports** I discourage using 1:1 to share the public news and weather "status report" - we can read that offline ourselves. A valuable use of time is the "inner and private stories" on the status - What is hard, what is most fun, where do you want to improve?
- **No deep dives when I could just do offline homework** I think 1:1 off the cuff deep dives are an anti-pattern, an indication that there's a missing artifact that'd be valuable to a wider audience. I'll often say can I get a TL;DR and "How would I go about learning X,Y or Z"? If the answer is "ask me", I'll often recommend a low quality on paper brain dump we can review together. This lets us efficiently have an async discussion which captures Q&A in a durable form. Once we've done the easy async discussion in the doc, we review the comments together with more complex questions, and more private context, and more discussion.

<!--

**Giving Feedback** Lots of contextual feedback can be given in "coaching moments" as soon as you've observed things. Other feedback is best delivered through follow up questions during the "what's on your mind" induced discussions.

**Getting Feedback** I try not to 'spend' my peeps 1:1 time, but I will both ask them generic feedback - what do you think I should stop/continue doing? And specific feedback - I'm thinking of X,Y,Z what's your reaction? Or, I did X,Y,Z last week, what did you observe?
-->

I have less frequent, but extremely important 1:1 types like:

- **Career discussions** A discussion around what we should be focused on for the next 6-18 months.
- **Promo preparation meetings** - Help ensure we're on the same page about what needs to happen for career trajectory and promo.
- **Performance Review Feedback**
- **Leadership card evaluation exercise** (so good, needs its own post)

Other thoughts:

- I aspire to be accessible - I encourage folks to come to me any time (but most don't).
- I "manage by walking around", just seeing what people are up to and working on.
- I group my 1:1's on the same day (or over 2 days) because 1:1 is a special frame of mind, and it's hard to stay in that zone.
- I wish I used a 1:1 document, as that seems to be a best practice for most domains.
- The current norm is 30 minute 1:1's but I enjoyed the old days when an hour was the norm. I often wonder if we've sacrificed effectiveness for efficiency in the 30 minute 1:1 culture.

### How do you handle communication problems

High order bits:

1. Success is not "communication style", but ability to influence. Influence comes in many forms and mediums.
1. Some things labelled communication problems, but they are much more serious and need to be handled differently. E.g. Lack of clarity of thought/intellectual horse power and being a jerk.
1. Focus on strengths is 3x as effective as shoring up weaknesses. Leverage strengths and partner with others to maximize influence.

There are different types of communication problems each needing a different strategy:

- Verbal diarrhea
- Dominates Conversations
- Abrasive communication style
- Not listening to others
- Unclearn writing (too verbose, not enough context)
- Verbal/ESL/Not comfortable with in-person verbal communications
  - Pre-write thoughts
  - Toast masters
  - Use pictures
  - Say not great on my feet, follow up with a document
- Uncomfortable in group settings

### How do you handle promotion preparation (and fever)

- Surprises are **BAD**:

  - Haven't set clear expectations.
  - Requires mini RCA

- Goal:

  - Engineer and Manager shared understanding of promo gaps and plan.
  - Engineer feels they came to conclusion himself
  - Engineer aspires to get to that level, and feels on track
  - Engineer gets new opportunities/support required.
  - Engineer doesn't want to be over leveled

- How: Start w assume engineer right - lets look at the criteria together.

  - Skim now and deep dive in next 1:1
  - Ask for self evaluation
  - Review and get on same page, sometimes manager thinks below and above what engineer does.
  - Go over with examples together
  - Ask "How would you describe your behavior vs someone else's"
  - Ask "What gaps do you see"

- How: Create a shared plan create plan to close the gaps
  - Projects that stretch in those areas
  - Mentors that can help close the gap on those areas
  - Training/etc

Promotion fever is my word for engineers that are completely focused on promotions above all else. In general they fall into a few categories: 1) Not Ready, 2) Just hired, and believe under levelled 3) Ready, but didn't get promo due to bad luck. Regardless, we go through the promotion preparation process.

### How do you identify and grow potential managers

Engineers that are interested in reading this post make good manager candidates. The path usually start with getting an intern, then being a tech lead with heavy mentoring. Then having them take over as many as people issues as people are comfortable with them tracking.

### How do you grow top talent

### Performance Reveiws: Calibrations PSC, OLR, Connections

[Performance reviews](https://imwrightshardcode.com/2021/06/discussing-rewards-for-people/) exist at most companies (I've been through Connects at MSFT, OLR at AMZN and PSC at FB), and for good reason they:

- Ensure performance is evaluated consistently.
- Provide forced feedback.
- Distribute compensation in accordance to impact.
- Validate growth plans and find opportunities across the organization.
- Assess bottom performers and ensure action is taken.

Best practices for performance reviews:

- Before Calibrations:

  - Continuous seeking feedback for team members, and anonymizing and providing feedback
  - Continuous explanation of how tracking is occurring
  - Doing mid point checkins, and peer manager review for hard situations (e.g. bottom performers and pending promotions)
  - Consistent presentation template - this makes it easy for everyone to assess the presentation of people.
  - Remind engineers you might find new data late, and what you do, that could change the assessment

- At the start of every calibration session. Reminder that:

  - Confidentiality is critical - Amazon says breaking confidentiality is a firing offense, which is great.
  - Reminder of the importance of catching unconscious bias.
  - Point is to calibrate the assessment process so it's fair.
  - Include senior engineers - this helps the engineers trust the process is fair, and provides critical input.

- After Calibrations:
  - No surprises to the engineers, they should already be aware of their rating as it's been provided consistently.
  - Provide as much feedback to engineers after the process, owning the message.
  - Focus on growth plans (see above sections)

Your role when representing people:

- Gather data on what happened through the evaluation period. Gather more data on things that surprise you (like peer feedback, or accomplishments you wer enot aware of)
- Present it as well as possible
- Ensure the presentation is evaluated fairly by seeking feedback and focusing on fairness.
- Calibrate yourself to ensure

a post on preparing for calibrations

### Recall career is just one part of your life

Often, when folks think of career development, they fixate on their job title and compensation. Those aspects are important, but I encourage folks I support that career is only [one aspect of life](https://bit.ly/igor-wlb-manifesto), and they should look at their life holistically

{%include blob_image.html src="blog/career-convo.png" %}

### How do you have a difficult converastion

From Simon Sinek, a great script:

- I need to have a difficult conversation
- Afraid to have this conversation,
- afraid to say something wrong, and accidentally trigger someone
- I know having this conversation is more important then my fears against it
- Please work with me to struggle through this.
- Because want us to tackle this subject

## Culture

<a id="l-culture"></a>

### What is your ideal culture

Tough question. I need to think through that

- Coming to work is fun, team gelled, and ahead of individuals

  - Team gelled, and always helping and growing each other
  - People put team ahead of themselves, to support each other.
  - Folks have high trust, so can be vulnerable, knowing others want to grow and support them.
  - Hanging out with your friends
  - Work filled with moments
  - Team first, whole greater then the sum of its parts
  - Everyone provides kuddos to others

- Imagination Executed Sustainably

  - Ship as frequently as possible.
  - Test cheaply, early and often.
  - Always paying down technical debt
  - Never be blocked
  - I hate the term "bring solutions not problems", it encourages people to freeze. Instead -
    - "bring ideas, even terrible ones, with your problems", caring and lead time to fix is most important

- Continuous improvement, with very open feedback, and desire to improve.
  - Career Growth
  - Technical Growth
  - Retros, but also action item tracking.

### How do you help a team gel

- Team lunches
- Moral Events
- Help people see each other as 3 dimensional humans - talk about personal stuff.
- Encourage people to think of the team as an entity, and how to improve the team, not themselves.
- Encourage people to vocalize their appreciation publicly
- Encourage people to ask for help, and get help
- Remind people it's intimidating to ask for help, and they can take a stand to make it happen.
- Have the team focus on success of the team, ahead of personal success.
- Encourage people to improve the team at every opportunity.

### What order would you introduce culture

When I joined FB we were full remote, and started with only 1 30 min team meeting every 2 weeks.
Here's what I worked with the team to establish

- 1 x week team meeting w/demos
- 1 x week team meeting
  - replaces 1x week demo and team meeting:
- 2 x week stand up
- 1 x week tech talk/deep dive
  - deep dive sessions, guest speakers, TIL sessions
- 1 x 2 week demos
- 1 x 2 week retro
- 3 x week lunch

### How do you make a good culture

- Model myself
  - On All the Pages
  - If team is working I'm working
  - When I make mistakes I apologies
  - If I drop the ball I make it clear.
  - When someone does well I celebrate and call out.
- Catch people doings things right
  - Coaching stuff
  - Put it front and center
  - Let team take ownership of it.
  - Incite pride and purpose
- Repeat/Repeat/Repeat

### How do you handle Remote Work

I'm writing this stuff [my rough outline](/remote-work)

### What about Work Life Balance

Work Life Balance is so important to me that I wrote a [manifesto](https://bit.ly/igor-wlb-manifesto) - the opening paragraph:

_I don't want to die knowing I spent too much time at work and I bet you don't either. As a result I want to work with people who value a culture encouraging them to balance their family, health, hobbies, and work - aka work-life balance. To make a culture real leaders needs to walk the talk, and I'll describe how I model a work-life balance, and the mechanisms I use to help team members achieve their own balance._

In the rare event you do want to die knowing you spent too much time at work, try to remember more hours rarely helps. In XKCD format:

{%include blob_image.html src="blog/more-hours.svg" %}

Equally important, when folks consider their career, I remind them there are more dimensions to their life, and they should think about their balance. There are some years and halfs where they want to focus on their career, and others where the focus will be family and health.

{%include blob_image.html src="blog/career-convo.svg" %}

### How you deal with team disagrees with the leadership

Step 1: Believe and deeply understand it. Either I believe in it, or I deeply understand the decision and have disagreed and committed. As part of committing, I'm all in, and will share that.

Step 2: Listen to the team. The team has concerns, hopefully I can predict the, ahead of time and be prepared for the easy ones, then truly listen to new concerns, and address them.

Step 3: Focus on the win/win, and talk through a ripcord.

### Agency and Psychological Safety

I gave a talk on [lies we tell ourselves](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1u8kswf7qUDdKgMlxBVRUXilwECv9sVWJtM6IMTuP5hQ/)

### Kudos Boards - Appreciations

Both helpful for a short period of time, and for a longer period of time, kuddos boards let the team get together and celebrate what they appreciate from their co-workers. This has many benefits:

- People are appreciated for thier contributions
- People are reminded how impactful their work is
- Good behaviors are recognized and reinforced
- The team bonds and grows

A nice format for this is a "clock" with everyone's name on it, and the center of the clock having great prompts like:

## Process and Mechanism

### Theory of Process

Why:

- Turn input into outputs
- Reduce variance and setup a pit of success.
- Scale
- The human equivalent of great tools (source control, linters, bug management systems)
- Don't waste "mental juice" on solved problems - see ([checklist manifesto](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B086XF436Z/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1))

How:

- How to measure success of the process, what will you inspect, when will you adjust?
- What other process is this similar to, can we co-coalesce with something else?
- How will you get buy in from up, out and down?
  - (Bright spot, then land and expand)
- Who is the owner?
- Ownership lifetime, per quarter, or forever.

Thoughts:

- The organizational equivalent of [habits](/habits)
- Culture vs Process

### The dark side of process

The upside of process is that we can do things without thinking. The downside is that we stop paying attention to process cost, small errors, and become resistant to change, which is often positive at a minimum and often required.

This can be especially true when process is created high in the org chart to solve a specific problem in another part of the org chart, and then applied universally, even where the problem does not exist.

**The antidote** - A review of process is essential to ensure it's still getting the maximum value with minimum cost.

**Toxic process** - Bad process will disenfranchise ownership and stifling passion. It'll slow down things that can be fast. There is nothing more powerful then a motivated engineer, don’t let process take that away.

### On Change

There are a few kinds of changes.

One way door changes should start with -100 points because:

1. There is only so much change a team can handle
1. Change has unexpected consequences,
1. Before the change, many problems, most of which you don't know about, have been solved by evolution, and will re-appear after the change.
1. Many solutions, are like a 4 sided rug in a 5 sided room, no matter the solution, you still end up with a problem, the devil you know vs the devil you don't.

Two way door changes are much safer when performed well:

1. Start with a pilot
1. Let the larger group adopt it if they feel it has value.
1. Come up with a criteria to roll back the change
1. Setup guard rails to monitor to roll back.

### That sounds like good intentions - Factories and Artisans

- Process vs Good Intentions
- Toyota Assembly line vs Artisan
- The inconsistency from passionate projects

### Never have a human do what a computer can do

- Use auto style for code review styles
- Gather data from bug systems instead of having humans do it.
- Automated tests vs human execution
- Multiple copies of the same data

### Rich communication - Team meeting

### Continuous Learning - Deep Dives, Knowledge Transfer and Guest Speakers

### Engineering Excellence - Operational Review and Correction of Errors

There should always been an on-call, an engineering excellence work stream, and a periodic review meeting and a [correction of errors](/coe) process.

1. How do we know our customer is having a good day?
2. How do we maximize our velocity
3. How do we keep our developers happy.
4. How do we sleep well at night?
5. How do we get max learning from outages?

By the way, I think a manager should be on all pages and outages.

- On all the pages
- Strong appreciation for boots on the ground reality.

Also need to review all outages

- Write up for all outages, [Correction Of Errors](/coe) for major outages -
- Maximize value of mistakes, don't make them twice.
- For all customer impacting event, review w/Customer Impact, root cause understood, and commitment when to address.
- Observability
  - How do we get a page next time.
  - How do we see what's going on.
- Testing systems.
  - Very high leverage active

### Data Driven - Customer and Business Metric Reviews

### Continuous Improvement - Retrospectives

### Team Participation and Feedback - Surveys and Polls

It's very easy to "think" the team is getting what they want, or has gotten what they want. A fast, easy way to validate this is having polls before something happens, and surveys after.

Some examples where we use polls:

- Should we move this meeting to another time?
- Where should we go for lunch
- What questions should we focus our limited time on?

Some examples where we use surveys:

- Which meetings are a good use of time (special survey)
- How are we doing on XYZ
- How helpful was this presentation, what could have gone better (TODO: link to a useful survey)

Pro tip for surveys - use part of a meeting to complete a fast survey. This ensures completion isn't just another thing that needs to be done.

### Quality and Technical Growth Design+Arch Reviews

- Really a preview, not a review.
- Ensure that tech assets are high quality and require minimal re-work.
- Ensure team gets cross trained.
- Catch stuff as early as possible
- Get developers used to being on the whiteboard

## Planning, Roadmaps and Resource Allocation

### Defining Success - How does goal setting work

The goal is to maximize the impact of the team.

Small companies and insulated teams can do bottom up goal settings, but as companies get larger, it's hard to have sufficient insight into the company priorities, and hard to align goals cross teams, which lessons the impact.

Larger teams require a top down business strategy intersected with a bottom up execution recommendation.

Ideally Engineering Excellence (EE) is built as part of a feature as it is in part of the feature costs. NOTE: It's OK to defer some of the engineering tasks till after shipping but it's not OK to say a project is complete till the Engineering excellence costs are paid.

Systems rot over time, so EE should have a standing budget, usually 10%-20% of team capacity. The team should be empowered to spend this budget as required.

For major projects, a large EE project is required (like a technology migration). This should be outside the standing 10-20% EE allocation. Such projects should be agreed to by the business and have explicit goals.

Technical Debt is often a bad thing, but like debt it is a good thing if there is a good chance a project will be abandoned and you won't need to pay the interest. Examples here are speculative projects which may be rolled back, and bridges to a future technology.

### How do you do planning and come up with roadmaps

6 step process

1. Define Tracks
1. Find "boulders" in each track
1. Break boulders into projects, cost and analyze and order by ROI
1. Determine cut lines
1. Resource allocate
1. Execute (It's 1% inspiration and 99% perception)

The only time when the 5 step process should occur simultaneously across all tracks is when a team is forming, or taking a major pivot. At all other times this series of steps should be occurring continuously and asynchronously.

The full process is expensive and the team should be shielded from some of it but here's some engagement that should happen:

- **Product Manager** - Fully engaged in every step.
- **Data Science** - Impact analysis and sizing
- **Projects and costing** - Senior and Staff engineers, because they have higher accuracy and this ensures their buy in.
- **Interested Parties** - The process should be transparent, and anyone wants to, including junior engineers, are welcome to see how the process works. However, given they aren't required for the process, this shouldn't come at the expense of their day jobs

[TODO Picture]

### How does resource allocation work

Resource allocation is maximizing the intersection in the Venn diagram - "Personal Preference", "Business Need" and "Probability of Success" for the business, team and individuals.

{%include mpl_render_float_right.html name="what-to-work-on" %}

The success metric for a manager is supporting the team so that they know the constraints, and can self organize to maximize the business, team and individual Venn diagram coverage.

This process gets harder then it sounds based on the state and ambiguity of the tracks, balancing juniors and seniors, career development desires, and future hires and business ambiguity and reorgs.

There are some more concepts I need to flesh out:

**Personal growth and career development** People should strive for projects that stretch them and make them grow. This is always a business priority (to make the team better), and usually a personal preference. There are times when people have other things going on, and don't want to grow, and that must be honored at a high priority.

**Opportunity cost** - If a senior developer is doing something a junior developer is doing, then you have turned your senior developer into a junior developer and no-one is doing the work of a senior developer. This is also why teams need a blend of junior, intermediate and senior developers.

**Right sizing projects, and support** When people are growing, stuff is going to be hard, and it's important they don't take on more then they can chew (see ability to succeed), even when the project is the right size, it's important the person has the dynamic support and mentorship they need.

**Keeping slack in the system** Anxiety is the difference between reality and expectations. Slack is the tool that helps us better model reality, and keep stress under control.

### The road building analogy to software development roles

Imagine we want to build a new road.

1. Start of time: PM figures out there's a market for a road, and the needs of the customer, and comes up with a rough idea of where the road needs to be between.
1. Slightly After: EM starts surveying broadly, and discovers can't go some places because there's a giant mountain, or somewhere else as other folks have tried digging there, but fell through, and that someone has started making a path from the other side, so if we meet at the middle it'll be cheaper
1. After: Senior Engineers come in and start figuring out where they'll build, what's the safest path, and what's a realistic schedule
1. After: Intermediate dev's are assigned a chunk of the road and start building it.
1. After: Junior devs are given very clear tasks, and start doing them.

### Prioritize Ruthlessly

A great mantra for life, individual contributors, and especially folks supporting more junior folks. A great article that deep dives into the topic [here](https://alexturek.com/2022-03-07-How-to-do-less/)

## Hiring

### What are you looking for when you recruit

Most companies have their “competencies” they test for. But I abstract it down to:

- Smart (Can code, understands, sees critical paths)
  - Teach me something you deeply understand
  - Walk through X, and Y, how do you, explain the trade offs.
- Get things done (wants to ship, owns it):
  - What matters to you?
  - Tell me something hard you did?
  - Tell me your favorite parts?
- EQ: (Not an asshole, Continuous Learning, Sees impact off his action, self aware, Team First )
  - Tell me a time you got in a fight
  - Tell me the hardest feedback you received.
  - Tell me the hardest feedback you gave

### Do they prefer to hire only experienced folks

I need a pipeline of developers for mentorship, fan out and succession planning.

Need a Principal per 30 people.

Ratio Senior: SDE-II: SDE-I (1,2,2) => ten person team: 2, 4, 4.

- Everyone grows by learning and teaching.
- A crappy job for an SDE Level-X is a growth opportunity for SDE Level-(X-1).
- SDE-IIIs want to think hard and lead.
- SDE-IIs do the bulk of the work, and are fully independent.
- SDE-I bring energy and excitement, but still dependent.

(Bad analogy) A team is like a "conveyor belt", people continually improve and mature and want larger scope, requiring a constant flow of incoming college hires.

### Are they more comfortable with generalists or specialists

Generalists - 99% of time

1. Industry changes to much.
2. Mostly about Architecture/Design and SDL and coding, domain and language easy to learn.

Specialist - 1% on very specific teams.

1. File system
2. Distributed system transaction processing.
3. Firmware engineers

Want full stack teams:

- FE -> Learn the customer empathy through user interactions
- BE -> Learn the tech chops of complex system.

### How do you think about hiring

My priority list:

1. A full blown site outage where the product is hard down and I'm actively getting it back online.
2. Recruiting
3. Everything else

Recruiting is ultimately product sales, where you're selling the team you support. Sales breaks down into the following:

1. Meeting the candidate's needs: Great salespeople don't sell their product, they understand and solve their customer's needs.
   Start by understanding what the candidate values and needs. If that's on your team, fantastic, if not help them find the team that's right for them.
2. Your solution: The product you're building, the culture and people on the team, and yourself.
3. The Funnel: Inbound Marketing, Referrals, high touch, post sales support (see next question)

### How do you think about the hiring funnel

- Before even thinking of funnels
  - Strive to be a class act and do your best.
  - It's a small world. [People will learn what you value, and how you work](/static/igor-feedback-LinkedIn.pdf)
  - Create [public artifacts](https://bitly.com/igor-wlb-manife)
- Top of Funnel
  - Interview events
  - Internal Talks
  - LinkedIn Posts
  - LinkedIn Appreciation
  - LinkedIn Articles
  - Always help recruiting
  - Connect to warm candidates
  - Go grab coffee with them
  - Mentorship of folks, volunteer for mentorship
  - Intern Talk
- Mid Funnel
  - Post interview - magic trick, after interview lets make time to chat
  - Push to get interviews done ASAP
  - Push to get results to candidate ASAP
  - Walk out of interview connect on linked in and chat with them
- Bottom of the Funnel
  - Focus on the needs of the candidate, then talk about how job can solve their needs
  - Beer/Coffee/Call
  - Share artifacts, and evidence of my teams operations
  - Invite them to talk with the team I support
  - Invite them to have lunch with the team
  - Help them build and evaluate their [dream job, and job switching decision making matrix](/job).

### What about structured vs free form interview loops

- External Structured

  - Leadership skills - most important
  - Self aware - a [critical part of being a leader](/what-makes-a-leader)
  - Design
  - Coding

- Internal, Structured but Different

  - Review internal code/design/documentation artifacts. Ask candidate for artifacts they're proud of.
  - Go on a whiteboard to have them explain one of their systems, or help you on yours. No need for the candidate to practice, this is just them doing their day job.
  - Talk about hard situations they've had. Listen for the criteria smart/gets shit done/emotionally intelligent

### What are better kinds of interviews

I've heard the tech interview model described as the second worst kind of assessment strategy, it's only better then everything else we know.

That might be true, but I've also seen some novel ideas for interviews (Indeed uses these), and I'd be interested to try using them:

- Do a code review
- Do a mock interview + debrief
- Review their public work (like Github)

### What do you do when someone says they are quitting

I always start with "Happy for you, sad for us".
My goal is to find the right role for an employee, not to have them on the team.
Ask if you want me to talk you out of it, or to reinforce your choice.
Help you think through decisions
TODO: Add story of Neha
Teams should be like rivers, not lakes. Rivers are fresh and move, lakes are stagnant which is bad

## Firing and Performance Management

### Firing Percents

TL;DR: Firing is a good thing. There is a natural percent of people who should be fired, and left to their own discretion many managers will not fire the full set of these people. At a large scale (100's of employees), and for periods of time (like during times of massive hiring), setting a firing ratio is a good thing. The key though is only enforcing it at a large scale, and having guard rails to make it objectively fair, and giving employees the ability to improve.

_And now the long version for non-managers_

If you've ever worked with a low performer who couldn't do their job, it's draining. They drag down the team due to missing commitments, and needing to be bailed out as unexpected work from the team. It's even a drag on the low performer as doing poorly in your job is a miserable experience, and they'll feel way better off in a place they are successful.

All of this is to say firing lower performers is a good thing.

And so the question becomes who should be fired? Given career expectations it should be clear when someone is not meeting expectations, and thus who managers should fire and when. It also turns out at large numbers statistics can help.

At the scale of 100's of employees there will be low performers unable to do their job. The exact value varies depending on how aggressive companies hire and deal with low performers, but I'd guess 1%-5%.

For a while, Amazon was getting terrible press, so they got rid of firing ratios. You know what happened? Way less then 1% of people were fired, meaning the manager's good judgment wasn't working well enough.

As a result Amazon re-instated it's firing ratios.

### The Process

### What are your thoughts on a PIP

Three "Players" in this situation:

- The struggling employee

  - Remember being in the wrong role SUCKS. Employee is going home after long day, and feeling like shit (rinse and repeat)
  - Once in right role - will feel great. Seen lots of times this happens.

  - Let employee 'self discover' gaps and judge, but you must set down the truth.
  - Should not be a surprise. Should have already gone through role guidelines and gaps.
  - Clear set of gaps, and expectation for required improvement.
  - Progressively lay out process, so they know where they're at and what happens next.
  - Help them know it's the wrong role, but they have lots of strengths (look we hired you), and you'll be well loved elsewhere.
  - Help them with how to find change, mock interview, job changing guidance

- The team
  - Weak performer means others on team have to cover both in mentoring, and picking up dropped ball.
  - Sets a bad example for the team
  - Team knows the weak, and dislikes it.
  - Need to mitigate impact of week employee.
- The manager.
  - Emotionally draining. But you own giving them an opportunity not their success.
  - When they're in the wrong role, best thing that happen is getting them to a place where they are successful.
  - Can be time and energy intensive, robs the team and good employees of your energy.
  - Ensure criteria for demonstrating employees recover is sufficient. Get pre-agreement on criteria with your organizational leaders.
  - Remember, all employee's getting into this process will improve because they are being chased. Ensure their improvement isn't temporary

Most companies have a well laid out process, that you follow.

First there's a "zone of concern", when the manager focuses carefully on the employee, without scaring the employee with the seriousness of the situation:

- Set employee up for max success
- Ensure clear expectations
  -- Get mentorship
- Explain to employee you believe in them.

Then there's an official pre-PIP. Which is the same as above, but really clear with employee.

- Document everything, and share with the employee so there is no miscommunication
- Ensure clear criteria for PIP removal.
- Ensure org agrees removal criteria is sufficient
- Meet weekly for formal review.

Then there's a formal PIP. Depends on your company but very similar to above, but with clear legal terminology.

### How do you deal with people performance issues

### How do you coach employee back to success

- Really depends on the employee
- Generally:
  - Re-enforce the person is good.
  - Remind person the team is there to help them
  - Clarify expectations
  - Provide a short term lowering of expectations
  - Consider LOA or accommodations as appropriate

## Charters, Re-orgs and Bootstrapping

Reorgs have two dimensions, staffing and charter, both of these need to be addressed.

There are several types of re-orgs. Here are some of the ones I've executed:

### The genesis: When you start from scratch

Building a team has two aspects, hiring from 0 to staffed, and building out a new charter and vision.

In an ideal world, you'd execute the following hiring plan:

- Start with a high level view of the business
- Put in places the senior developers to build out the architecture and process
- Start working by getting your SDE-IIs and SDE-Is

In the real world, you'll likely:

- Have a vague idea
- Add people as you find them (hard stop when too many juniors - see below)
- Pick some easy wins, and get those started, ready to pick up debt to see what we can do.

Note: It's usually easy to hire junior people, and when there's pressure to start, you'll be tempted to just keep adding junior folks. However, there's a world of hurt here. If you're planning on starting with too many junior folks (or getting pressured to) borrow more experienced folks from other teams. Ideally borrow them full time for a few quarters, but at least borrow them for brainstorming, design, architecture and mentorship.

Hopefully, early in your hiring process you've been thinking about your charter. Charters and such are hard, here's the strategy I tackle:

- Come up with a north star vision
- Start your first experiments in tech and market
- Find the first wins to be able to inspire the team, excite the investors, and really partners.
- Build out an early roadmap and product.
- Keep learning and improving as people join.

### Telling the team

Assume this will be very hard on the team. It's critical they hear it from you first. It shows respect, and lets you reduce the largest anxieties. This will be emotional for a lot of people, and the team will be deeply influenced by your emotions. While you should acknowledge the loss, and the potential uncertainty and upcoming bumpiness, you **must be positive about the future**.

To ensure everyone hears from you first I recommend the following:

The days before:

1. Write an FAQ for the questions you expect.
1. Practice your story the day before with people you trust, review and tune your FAQ

The day of:

1. Clear your day of all meetings.
1. Schedule team meeting at the end of the day.
1. Make a list of everyone on the team and when you'll be telling them:
   - Check your timing to make sure you can get everyone done, taking into consideration when people come in.
   - Write out what you think their top concerns will be, to ensure you focus on them
   - After every meeting take notes about their concerns, and good talking points for future meetings.
1. Meet folks ad-hoc first starting first thing in the morning to have enough time.
1. Plan to grab people ad-hoc, and give them as much time as they need. This ensures - You'll be on time to this high impact meeting. - You'll not be in a rush, you can give people as much time as they need. - You have time to take notes after the meetings and tune your message, and re-charge your positivity
1. When deciding the order, start with the folks that'll take it best.
   - This will let you have some "easier sessions" to tune your message
   - This will give you new talking points, and get new questions
1. When talking to people
   - Make sure you have high energy reserves, but keep your energy low and caring, talk slowly like this is the first time you've told anyone.
   - Warn people it's gonna be a big surprise
   - Remind people they matter and that's why you made sure they heard it from you first.
   - Let them know who you've told and who they can talk to.
   - Remind them it's essential not to talk to anyone else till the team meeting so everyone hears it from you.
   - If they are in shock, and don't know what to talk about, ask them if they'd like you to tell them about your experience, and common questions others have
   - Tell them they'll have lots more questions, you'll talk through them at the team meeting, and they'll have more questions in the coming days, and that you'll book time with them over the next few days.
   - Make a note of how they took it, and if you get more talking points
   - Tell the people that are more positive how they can help make it easier on the team, think about when they can jump in during the team meeting.
   - Use silence to let people digest and come up with questions
1. In the team meeting
   - Tell people you'll recap what you talked about, and give a more complete story
   - Hit all your FAQs, including the hard ones
   - Prompt the people that can add positive ideas (who you already asked) to share the positive parts
   - Be available after the meeting, and offer to talk to anyone
   - Remind people you don't have all the answers yet but you'll figure them out together.
   - Give people as much autonomy as possible, tell them they should tell you the best way to wrap up their projects.
1. In the next few days:
   - Be around a lot, offer to talk to anyone anytime.
   - Schedule meetings with everyone in case they have more questions. If they don't, you can leave early.

### The FAQ

- How does this impact my review?
- How long till we stabilize?
- Why did this happen?
- Did we do something wrong
- What choices do we have? Can we follow the re-org
- What happens to my existing/ongoing project
- How is their existing work evidence of greatness
- Is it just gonna happen again in 6 months
- What are the exciting opportunities, and why are they better then the old ones
- Why is this re-org designed the way it, why would you have done the re-org this way.
- Will more people be hired
- Answer how to motivate them:
  - Autonomy - Let them recommend the transition plan.
  - Mastery - Remind them how good they are and how the team will succeed on the next project
  - Purpose - Remind them of the continuity of purpose and
  - [Motivation Deep Dive](#l-motivation)
- What am I working on next
- How long till we have more clarity
- Why is this a good thing (people, tech, purpose)
- How long have you known
- How long till you felt good about it
- Domain specific questions

### The split: When a team outgrows a manager

### The merge or you leaving the team: When a manager leaves

### Splitting Horizontally vs Vertically

When you have multiple teams, and multiple user scenarios you decide to organize horizontally (each team owns tech solutions, spanning multiple user scenarios), or vertically (each team owns user scenarios, spanning tech solutions).

This is hard, a few thoughts I've gathered:

Deciding if you split horizontally vs vertically is at the highest level asking what you want care more about:

- customer metrics vs engineering metrics and efficiency.
- what's best for the customer vs what's best for the platform.

Depending on how much tech needs to be build and how much specialization is required you will need horizontal teams. For example, the operating system, the networking stack, the hardware are all horizontals.

TODO: Table of pros and cons

### The flip: When charter changes

There are two categories of flips: A) Flip to new domain (genesis) or B) Flip to take over another teams space. Genesis is mostly covered above, so here we'll focus on taking over another teams, or another teams partial charter.

In general when this happens there are a few common reactions

**The new charter is too small**

A common reason for this is the old team that had the charter, likely only planned out for 120% of there engineers. So, if they had 2 engineers available, they planned for 3 engineers of work. A new incoming team having 10 people, will think there's only work for 3 people, and be sad.

**The new charter is much simpler then expected**
**The new charter isn't' as interesting**

It's common to oversimplify from a distance. Once the team gets into the details, they'll either see it's true, and they'll find new good stuff to do, or, far more likely they'll find much more nuance, subtlety and ambiguity in the new space.

**Playbook and antidotes**

This is pretty similar to the whole team getting a new job, and [the first 90 days applies](/90days):

- Early Win: Figure out the situation, and deliver a win.
- Trust: Relationships with team, and peers, and partners.
- Knowledge: Know critical parts of business, tech, org.

A great way to do this is set the team up to do spikes on the major work items, this will overcome the above concerns, building knowledge and motivating the early wins.

## Personal Motivations

I guess the whole post is personal, as these are my opinions. The questions below can't be "evaluated" as they deal with internal motivations, however they can be questioned to determine if these are really my motivations, and if I"m being consistent between my actions and motivations.

### Why is management attractive to Igor

Few things make me prouder then this [public feedback on LinkedIn](/static/igor-feedback-LinkedIn.pdf) from people who worked with me over several years.

On my deathbed, the product I will be most proud of is the people who I watched blossom and grow. It's cliche, but when you love your people they know it, they thrive, and do their best work. It's not just about the work, I want to make sure people think of their lives as well, because, well, that's even more important.

I'm also energized by getting shit done. The though of shipping, clearing roadblocks, and never being blocked puts a smile on face.

Speaking of smiling, nothing brings me back up like reading this kind of feedback that I got when I left a team:

_Goodbye Igor! Thank you for helping me reach the next level both physically and mentally. I cherish the moments when we ground through challenges like peak days, when I was in trouble and you said "That's why I'm here, give it to me I'll make it happen", and of course, when you show your magic at happy hour! You are a great boss and great teacher._

Lastly, I love understanding what is going on, coming up with win/win solutions, and framing those solutions into a meaningful story that people rally behind and deliver. Some more words that bring me up:

_Igor - Your passion, energy, intellect, and sheer force of will -- so intense, so inspiring, so powerful we still feel it 3 years after you left the team._

<!--

- Skill, clarifying, building consensus, sharing the story and meaning.
- Leader Ownership, but not a good enough PM, and very strong tech
- Lead and inspire
- Servant leadership
- On top of best practices
-->

### What is Igor's dream job

A preview of [my dream job](/job):

_Jobs have many dimensions and I'll describe my dream job in several dimensions. In my dream job I learn the customer and business needs and focus the team on delivering them in a sustainable manner. Simultaneously, I help team members grow, develop our culture, and build valuable tech. When talking to others I prefer a couch to a table, and when I need a break you might see me juggling, practicing magic, or riding my folding bike - often in the office._

### What is Igor's career aspiration

A preview of [I want to be the best boss my peeps have ever had](/being-a-great-manager)

_I aspire not only to be a great manager, but to be the best manager my team members will ever have (unless they get to work for a manager I've coached :) ). I hope to have incredibly stiff competition at the top, and I'll often fall short of my goal, but through trying I will get closer. This post will gather my research on being a great manager, enumerate some of my learnings, and inspire me to be my best._

### Why do you think Igor is a good coach

When I explained to someone coaching it the most important aspect of management, they asked why I thought I was a good coach. Took me a while to answer, but here you go:

- I believe you can't be efficient with people, you can only be effective. And it always pays off.
- People are not 'resources', they are 3 dimensional humans, with [lives outside work](https://bit.ly/igor-wlb-manifesto), emotions(like [pride](/pride)), and desires.
- I've read and digested slews of [self help books](/books) which while often mocked, are filled with great models.
- I actively study and practice [coaching](/coach) and effective [decision making](/decide)

### Why do you prefer being a manager vs an IC

I think as a manager, the day to day sucks. People problems, managing by spreadsheet, fire fighting, policy violations, etc. But, those days when you look at the team, and see them helping each other, and growing, and when you catch people after a few years and they tell you how impactful you were to their career, and how working on the team was the most fun they ever had - it feels superb.

As an IC, it's almost backwards, the day to day is fun. Coding, design, debugging, even fire fighting an outage trying to get the site back up, it's very satisfying in the moment. But, as an IC, when you look at the software you built, and you realize it's long deprecated, and replaced by something better, it's a pretty meh feeling.

So, in a nutshell, for me those moments of intense satisfaction make it worth the loss of the day to day joy of being an engineer.

At each stage of road productions things go wrong and we learn new stuff. TODO Come up with more examples

### What if managers memorize these answers for interviews

Good interviewees prepare as much as possible, thinking through their experiences and philosophies. If this post helps them, that is fantastic. I'm skeptical a bad manager will be able to internalize these answers to the point they can provide rich answers.

Good interviewers (and manager interviews better be good) need to be able to differentiate "theoretical knowledge" from "practical experience". They do this with situational questions like "Tell me a time when", and probing questions like "What happened then? What were the unexpected consequences? When did you have the opposite outcome?".

## Business Acumen and Strategy

My note on [Strategy](/strategy), including the strategic position of various companies:

_Strategy is creating fit among a company's activities. The success of a strategy depends on doing many things well and integrating among them. If there is no fit among activities, there is no distinctive strategy and little sustainability. Management reverts to the simpler task of overseeing independent functions, and improving operational effectiveness, a race to the bottom._

## Analogies to be fleshed out

### Piniata

The need for maturity and alignment

### A project is car with a EM, PM and TL

The need for variable engagement

### An engineering team as the parts of the car

PM - Navigator and long term radar
EM - Shock absorbers, mid term radar, swerve system
Specific team members for engine, seat belts, etc

### New hire perspective is like landing a plane

- When joining high altitude can see the city
- Once landed, all you can see is the air port and a few streets

## Questions managers get

### What do you do all day

See [the managers schedule](#l-what-managers-schedule) section.

### What's the best/worst part of your job

See [what do managers do](#l-what-managers-do) section.

### How do you get anything done with all of those meetings

The majority of the things I do are about amplifying, de-risking and unblocking people. Much of that works best when there's someone else in the room. Further many of those meetings, especially 1:1s and small groups energize me, making me able to tackle the rest of my with gusto.

For tasks that require me to be heads down and [write/think](/write) I try to get that done crazy early in the morning when I have zero interruptions and maximum intellectual horsepower.

### What do you think developers do

### How can devs do to make managers jobs easier

**Realize you and the team are a domain expert**

Due to positional authority, managers statements can be overweighted. However, managers by not being immersed in the problem know the least. Remind the team, and yourself, that the manager knows the least about the tech, and their words should not be overweighted.

**No surprises**

- If stuff goes wrong share it ASAP, the manager would love to do the same
- Discuss what you want and need, and if you're getting it

**Give insight into places manager has no visibility**

- When people are upset/demoralized/angry, often ICs know before managers as people don't tell managers. Sharing this with a manager is great so they can take action.
- Give feedback, especially hard feedback.

### How does a dev find out if they’d be good at or enjoy being a manager

**Preview as much as you can:**

- Intern
- Mentor
- Volunteer to do jobs for the manager
- As a technical lead do some proto managing on behalf of the real Manager.

**Be a strong IC first**

Make sure you're a senior enough engineer before becoming a manager (AMZN - L6; FB - E6; MSFT - L65). Once you become a manager, your technical skill drops as most of your energy is focused on other tasks. So, if you don't have a strong enough base, you'll lose your ability to help assess and provide input on technical tasks.

I don't think manager's should code, however (see above). A related question might be:

Why do we assess managers ability to code.

- A few enlightened companies do not.

When should managers code
