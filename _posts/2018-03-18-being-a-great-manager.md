I aspire not only to be a great manager, but to be the best manager my team members will ever have (unless they get to work for a manager I've coached :) ). I hope to have incredibly stiff competition at the top, and I'll often fall short of my goal, but by trying I will get closer. This post will gather my research on being a great manager, enumerate some of my learnings, and inspire me to be my best.

## Behaviors I do that I'm proud of:

- Coaching is critical to being a great manager - an excellent primer is [The 7 coaching questions](/Coaching-Questions).
- When we remember work, we think about our [peak moments](/moments-at-work).
- [Human Meetings](/human-meetings)
- The team members are my most important customer, and will be treated as such.
- Building high performance teams
  - Encouraging team to eat lunch together
  - Encouraging team to share their out side of work passions.
  - Building team ownership over individual ownership.
- Team wide appreciation
  - Weekly linked in posts celebrating the team
  - Cook the team breakfast
- Individual specific recognition
  - Continuous on the spot recognition.
  - [Pending] Hand written notes
- Keeping everyone informed and proud
  - Monthly newsletters
  - Draw pictures/pen casts
- Hiring Strategies
  - Posts on management philosophy like [Work Life Balance](/sustainable-work)
  - Weekly linked in posts celebrating the team
- Ease at which my team can collaborate across the larger organization.
- Leadership card experience
- Team wide engagement through clustering [exercises](https://www.oxfordhomeschooling.co.uk/blog/brainstorming-clustering/).
- Self-service management through fortune cookies.
- Some behaviors I'm just starting, these include
  - Team music videos
  - Engineering peak moments

- Employee career velocity.
- Employee referrals
- Employee feedback (Linked recommendations)
- Delivery velocity
- Business success

## Per company principles for being a great manager

### Google's Project Oxygen

Google is a very data driven, willing to challenge the status quo company. One of their ideas was getting rid of managers all together, and that was a fa [failure](). Given then conclusion managers were necessary, they formed Project Oxygen, a data driven approach to understanding the attributes of successful managers. Here is there list of management [attributes](https://rework.withgoogle.com/blog/the-evolution-of-project-oxygen/):

1. Is a good coach
1. Empowers team and does not micromanage
1. Creates an inclusive team environment, showing concern for success and well-being
1. Is productive and results-oriented
1. Is a good communicator - listens and shares information
1. Supports career development and discusses performance
1. Has a clear vision/strategy for the team
1. Has key technical skills to help advise the team
1. Collaborates across the company
1. Is a strong decision maker

### Amazon's leadership principles

All of Amazon's (leadership principle)[https://www.amazon.jobs/principles] are superb, and while they apply to everyone, they probably have a twist for managers (which I'm still figuring out).

**Hire and Develop the Best** - Leaders raise the performance bar with every hire and promotion. They recognize exceptional talent, and willingly move them throughout the organization. Leaders develop leaders and take seriously their role in coaching others. We work on behalf of our people to invent mechanisms for development like Career Choice.

**Earn Trust** - Leaders listen attentively, speak candidly, and treat others respectfully. They are vocally self-critical, even when doing so is awkward or embarrassing. Leaders do not believe their or their team's body odor smells of perfume. They benchmark themselves and their teams against the best.

**Deliver Results** - Leaders focus on the key inputs for their business and deliver them with the right quality and in a timely fashion. Despite setbacks, they rise to the occasion and never settle.

**Think Big** - Thinking small is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Leaders create and communicate a bold direction that inspires results. They think differently and look around corners for ways to serve customers.

**Customer Obsession** Leaders start with the customer and work backwards. They work vigorously to earn and keep customer trust. Although leaders pay attention to competitors, they obsess over customers.

**Are Right, A Lot** - Leaders are right a lot. They have strong judgment and good instincts. They seek diverse perspectives and work to dis confirm their beliefs.

**Ownership** Leaders are owners. They think long term and don't sacrifice long-term value for short-term results. They act on behalf of the entire company, beyond just their own team. They never say "that's not my job".

**Invent and Simplify** - Leaders expect and require innovation and invention from their teams and always find ways to simplify. They are externally aware, look for new ideas from everywhere, and are not limited by "not invented here". As we do new things, we accept that we may be misunderstood for long periods of time.

**Learn and Be Curious** - Leaders are never done learning and always seek to improve themselves. They are curious about new possibilities and act to explore them.

**Insist on the Highest Standards** - Leaders have relentlessly high standards - many people may think these standards are unreasonably high. Leaders are continually raising the bar and drive their teams to deliver high quality products, services and processes. Leaders ensure that defects do not get sent down the line and that problems are fixed so they stay fixed.

**Bias for Action** - Speed matters in business. Many decisions and actions are reversible and do not need extensive study. We value calculated risk taking.

**Frugality** - Accomplish more with less. Constraints breed resourcefulness, self-sufficiency and invention. There are no extra points for growing headcount, budget size or fixed expense.

**Dive Deep** - Leaders operate at all levels, stay connected to the details, audit frequently, and are skeptical when metrics and anecdote differ. No task is beneath them.

**Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit** - Leaders are obligated to respectfully challenge decisions when they disagree, even when doing so is uncomfortable or exhausting. Leaders have conviction and are tenacious. They do not compromise for the sake of social cohesion. Once a decision is determined, they commit wholly.
