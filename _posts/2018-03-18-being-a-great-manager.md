I aspire not only to be a great manager, but to be the best manager my team members will ever have (unless they get to work for a manager I've coached :) ). I hope to have incredibly stiff competition at the top, and I'll often fall short of my goal, but through trying I will get closer. This post will gather my research on being a great manager, enumerate some of my learnings, and inspire me to be my best.

Few things make me prouder then this [public feedback on LinkedIn](/static/igor-feedback-LinkedIn.pdf) from people who worked with me over several years.

I'm also writing a "manager guidebook", much of this post is migrating to the [manager-book](the-manager-book) and I'm decidign what should be in which post

## How will I measure my success?

Acting is easy, but results are hard. Here are the results I measure.

### Coach, empower, build inclusive and supportive culture

- Employee surveys (MS poll, Amazon connections, Amazon tech survey, Amazon Forte)
- Employee referrals and [public feedback (from LinkedIn)](/static/igor-feedback-LinkedIn.pdf)
- Employee career velocity relative to median (you can ask me the ratio in person).

### Productive and results-oriented

- Trains run on time and frequently.
- Ruthless prioritization (Shipping is a feature)
- Define and deliver business priorities.

### Great partner to other teams and non-tech partners

- Biz functions understands team and tech constraints
- My team understand constraints and needs of partner teams and biz functions.
- Team not blocked on other teams or biz functions.

## How will I behave to be successful?

As I tell my teams, the what lags the how, here's my how.

### Being a great coach

- The team members are my most important customer, and will be treated as such.
- Coaching is critical to being a great manager - an excellent primer is [The 7 coaching questions](/Coaching-Questions).
- When we remember work, we think about our [peak moments](/moments-at-work).
- [Human Meetings](/human-meetings)
- Building intra-team cohesion
  - Encouraging team to eat lunch together
  - Encouraging team to share their out side of work passions.
  - Building team ownership over individual ownership.
- Team wide appreciation

_This is answered directly in Igor's [book of management](/the-manager-book)_

- I finally hosted a hack-a-thon for my parent team. Here is my advice for folks setting this up.

### Some behaviors I'm just starting, these include

As a manager, you'll run into these situations. Each company and team has their own culture around these situations, and I'll enumerate things I've learned for them.

## Igors Super Powers

### Why do people think Igor is a good coach?

Someone once asked my why I'm a good coach, took me a while, here's what I came up with.

- I believe you can't be efficient with people, you can only be effective. And it always pays off.
- People are not 'resources', they are 3 dimensional humans, with [lives outside work](https://bit.ly/igor-wlb-manifesto), emotions(like [pride](/pride)), and desires.
- I've read and digested slews of [self help books](/books) which while often mocked, are filled with great models.
- I actively study and practice [coaching](/coach) and effective [decision making](/decide)

## Other Resources

To collect my thoughts, I'm writing a [book of manager](/the-manager-book) which is full of manager resources.
