---In 2019 I created a program for 15 fantastic interns! A program highlight was my talk titled "What I wish I knew at 22, and so might you". The talk received a 94% overall rating from over 15 interns, 10 SDE-IIs, and 1 senior developer. Even though the talk focuses on how to live the good life, a big chunk of life is work, so there's good coverage on how to optimize your career.
