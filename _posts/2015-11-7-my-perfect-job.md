I learn the needs of the business, and focus the team on delivering in a sustainable manner. At the same time, I help the team members grow, develop our culture, and build valuable tech.

When talking to others, I prefer a couch to a table, and when I need a break you might see me juggling, practicing magic, or riding my folding bike - often in the office.

I'm interested in a wide variety of roles, but a team figuring out how to make users happier in support of a business need gets a **tonne** of points in my job evaluation criteria.

Below are the dimensions in which I think of my jobs.  The lets me, and others, reflect on the essence of the job I want.


### B2C, B2B, Infrastructure? B2C!

At this point in my career I'm interested in making the lives of others better. Right now, I'd like to do this via consumer software.

### Product Domain? Productivity and Positive Computing!

As a human, I'm incredibly passionate about the related fields of productivity and positive psychology. I'd like to harness this passion to make the world a better place.


### Technologist or Entrepreneur: Entrepreneur!

As I get older, I'm finding more satisfaction in solving a customers problem then in making the most out of technology.
That said, I'm a technologist at heart, so I place a deep influence on the architecture as technology is the tool with which the entrepreneur meets the customer and business needs.

### Product/Market Risk vs Technical Risk: Product/Market Risk!

Incubations need to prove a risk can be overcome, either product/market or technical.  Product/market risk is "Do customers want your product", while  technical risk is "Can we build the tech to deliver it".

I'm most interested in proving product/market fit. That said, with over 15 years experience as a software engineer, I'm well versed in resolving technical risk, an expert at system design, code, and mentoring developers.

### Signals, Inferences, Experiences? Experiences!

A lot of modern software can be decomposed in three layers: signals, inferences and experiences. Signals are the raw the input in the system, both static, and dynamic. Inferences are the computations performed over the signal to determine something meaningful, this often involves big data and ML. Experiences are the way inferences and signal are presented to the user, this is often an app and the services which power the app. Inferences and experiences often become new signal to drive the system.

I'm most interested in building the experiences, but that requires me to deeply understand and drive signals and inferences.
### Business, Experience, Technology: Business and Experience!

Technology leaders need to divide their time among the business, experiences, and technology. While each of these are interesting at this point in my career Im most interested in the business and experiences.
