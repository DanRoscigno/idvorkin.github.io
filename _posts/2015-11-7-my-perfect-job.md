I learn the needs of the business, and focus the team on delivering in a sustainable manner. At the same time, I help the team members grow, develop our culture, and build valuable tech.

When talking to others, I prefer a couch to a table, and when I need a break you might see me juggling, practicing magic, or riding my folding bike - often in the office.

I'm interested in a wide variety of roles, but a team figuring out how to make users happier in support of a business need gets a **tonne** of points in my job evaluation criteria.

The below listicle are the dimensions in which I think of my jobs.  The listicle will let me, and hopefully others, reflect on the essence of the job I want.


### B2C, B2B, Infrastructure? B2C!

At his point in my career I'm interested in making the lives of others better. Right now, I'd like to do this via end user software.

### Product Domain? Productivity and Positive Computing

As a human, I'm increbily passionate about the related fields of productivity and positive phychology. I'd like to harness this passion to make the world a better place.


### Technologist or Entreprenuer: Entreprenur

As I get older, I'm finding more satisfaction in solving a customers problem then in making the most out of technology.
That said, I'm a technologist at heart, so I place a deep influence on the architecture as technology is the tool with which the entrprenuer meets the customer and business needs.

### Product/Market Risk vs Technical Risk: Product/Market Risk Fit.

Incubations need to prove a risk can be over come, either product/market or techincal.  Product/market risk is about do customers actually want your product, and technical is about can the techincal feasiblity be over come.

I'm most interested in closing product/market fit, even though my many years as a technogist makes me well versed in resolving technical risk.
