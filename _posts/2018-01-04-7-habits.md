Ever wish you had a user manual for your life? Imagine how reassuring it would be to know you can look up your difficulties in the table of contents, and read the chapter on how to solve your problem. For me, that manual is the The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People and it contains a model which I apply to many of my personal and professional problems and goals.

I use the concepts in this book as the basis of my self improvement and coaching. To help me internalize the 7 habits, I'm creating [video summaries](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1J7GM3GLzw&list=PLJveOxX-mxxCl4YDfHMyNzMmWUMFxgC1n) of the key concepts.

The habits are the basis of many self improvement books which often zoom into a specific habit. Here are the habits and the books I've read which are the "deep dive":
