Ever wish you had a user manual for your life? Imagine how reassuring it would be to know you can look up your difficulties in the table of contents, and read the chapter on how to solve your problem. For me, that manual is the The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People. It teaches you how to go from being dependant, to independent to interdependant, and doing it again and again in different aspects of your life. And oh yeah, if you've read a self help book, there's an excellent chance it's a rehash or deep dive into these concepts.

| Progression             | Chapters |
| ----------------------- | -------- |
| Dependant (**Them**)    | [l1](l1) |
| Independent (**Me**)    | [l2](l2) |
| Interdependant (**We**) | [l3](l3) |
| Renewal                 | [l4](l4) |

I use the concepts in this book as the basis of my self improvement and coaching. To help me internalize the 7 habits, I'm creating [video summaries](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1J7GM3GLzw&list=PLJveOxX-mxxCl4YDfHMyNzMmWUMFxgC1n) of the key concepts.

A little picture I drew when I'd just discoverved the 7 habits ...

### Sharpen the saw

- What does success look like

### First things First

- Stay in quadrant 2

### Sharpen the Saw

- Is technology helping me, or is it hurting me?

### Be Proactive

- Pause between stimuls and response
- Who has helped me be grow?
- Stop using reactive language
- Use empowering lanuage (I choose, I will)
- Is this in my circle of incluence, or circle of concern?

### Synergize

- How can I compliment someone around me?

### Think Win/Win

- If it's not WIN/WIN, it's LOSE/LOSE.

### First Understand

- Imagine an eye doctor tried to make you use their glasses
