Ever wish you had a user manual for your life? Imagine how reassuring it would be to know you can look up your difficulties in the table of contents, and read the chapter on how to solve your problem. For me, that manual is the The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People. It teaches you how to go from being dependant, to independent to interdependant, and doing it again and again in different aspects of your life. And oh yeah, if you've read a self help book, there's an excellent chance it's a rehash or deep dive into these concepts.

| Progression             | Chapters |
| ----------------------- | -------- |
| Dependant (**Them**)    | [l1](l1) |
| Independent (**Me**)    | [l2](l2) |
| Interdependant (**We**) | [l3](l3) |
| Renewal                 | [l4](l4) |

- l1
- [Core Concepts](/7h-c0)
- [Be Proactive](/be-proactive)

<div/>
- l2
- [Begin with the end in Mind](/end-in-mind)
- [First things first](/first-things-first)

<div/>
* l3
* [Win Win or No Deal](/win-win)
* [Seek First to Understand Then to be understood](/first-understand)
* [Synergize](/synergize)

<div/>
* l4
- [Sharpen the saw](/sharpen-the-saw)

I use the concepts in this book as the basis of my self improvement and coaching. To help me internalize the 7 habits, I'm creating [video summaries](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1J7GM3GLzw&list=PLJveOxX-mxxCl4YDfHMyNzMmWUMFxgC1n) of the key concepts.
