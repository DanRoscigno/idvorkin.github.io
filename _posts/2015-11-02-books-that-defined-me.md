Each of us is defined by the books we read. Here are some that defined me.

### Overall

### On doing the things you want to do.

**The Big Orange Splot** - Live [your dreams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cPfjzYJcok). 

> "He's just like Plumbean!" the people said. "He's got bees in his bonnet, bats in his belfry, and knots in his
noodle!"

> Then, one by one, they went to see Mr. Plumbean, late at night.  They would sit under the palm trees and
drink lemonade and talk about their dreams.

> And whenever anybody visited Mr. Plumbean's house, the very
next day that person would set about changing his own house to fit his dreams. 

**The Flinch** The resistance is the voice in your head that makes you afraid.  F#$ the resistance!

**The Dip** Quit everything that doesn't get you were you want to be.

**V is for Vulnerable**  Life is scary, hard, and totally worth it.
