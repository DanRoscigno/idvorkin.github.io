**[Essentialisim](/essentialism)** A life is well lived by picking what goes on your todo list, not by how many things you can check off your todo list.

**The checklist manifesto** Why checklists free you to be creative, and models allow you to better explore the world.

### On emotional health and intelligence

**[Seach Inside Yourself (SIY)](/search-inside-yourself)** How to train emotional intelligence through mindfulness

**[Getting To Yes with yourself](/getting-to-yes-with-yourself)** Handling the hardest negotiating oppoent - yourself. I didn't enjoy the presentation of the book, but the essence is excellent.


### On doing the things you want to do.

_"He's just like Plumbean!" the people said. "He's got bees in his bonnet, bats in his belfry, and knots in his noodle!"_

_Then, one by one, they went to see Mr. Plumbean, late at night.  They would sit under the palm trees and drink lemonade and talk about their dreams._

_And whenever anybody visited Mr. Plumbean's house, the very next day that person would set about changing his own house to fit his dreams._

**The Flinch** The resistance is the voice in your head that makes you afraid.  F#$ the resistance!

**The Dip** Quit everything that doesn't get you were you want to be.

**V is for Vulnerable**  Life is scary, hard, and totally worth it.

### On strategy

**Essentialism** You must trade-off. You can do one thing. What is most important? If you didn't have this thing would you buy it? If you didn't have this opportunity, what would you give up for it?

### On being a technologist
    TBD

### On being an entrepreneur
    TBD

### On thinking, storytelling, and  presenting
**Ed Emberly's Make a world** The hard part of drawing is seeing, and this book lets you "see" how simple many objects are.
