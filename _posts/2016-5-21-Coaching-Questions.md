Coaching is not giving advice, it's helping others solve their own problems. 

### 7 Questions To Coach: 

* Open: What's on your mind?
* Expand: What Else?
* Focus Problem: What's the real challenge here for you?
* Focus  Need: What do you want?
    * Do not ask why, it makes people defensive - you're question their ability by asking why.
    * Want vs Need
* Focus Request: How can I help?
* Focus  Trade off: If you say yes to this, what will you have to say no to?
    * Omission - automatic no
    * Commission - what you must deliberately give up to make it happen (relationships/projects/)
* Close the loop: What was most useful for you in this conversation?

### Depth of coaching - Performance vs Development (P vs PC)

* P: Project - Immediate task
* P: People - Relationship
* PC: Pattern - Help person get better.

### Coaching Strategy

* What does success mean?
* What is our scope (who/where)
* What will be our differentiator/moat here?
* What capabilities/assets will need to achieve this?
* How do we measure success and provide feedback?

### Keeping people safe:

TERA - 

* *Tribe:* Tribe, 'us' vs 'them' - be us.
* *Certainty* People dislike ambiguity/uncertainty.
* *Rank*  Do I move up or down the social ladder
* *Autonomy* I have control


### Soften How Can I help.

* Out of curiosity
* Just so I know
* To help my understand better
* To make sure I'm clear


SCARF Model:
*Fairness* People will injure themselves to ensure fairness.


### Handling: How would you handle this: 

Great question, I have some ideas, but first, how would you tackle this? What else?

### Saying No: Say Yes Slowly:
* Why are you asking me?
* Whom else have you asked?
* What you say urgent what do you mean?
* What does done mean?
* If I could only do one part, what part would you have me do?
* What do you recommend I take off my plate to get this done?want done?

*If you still have to say no*  Make sure you're saying no to task, no to person. Just writing it down will help.
