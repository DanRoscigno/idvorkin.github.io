Making decision is hard, but using Heath's WARPed framework we can make them easier and more effective.

 SUM UP WHERE we are. If you think about a normal decision process, it usually proceeds in four steps:
• You encounter a choice.
• You analyze your options.
• You make a choice.
• Then you live with it.
And what we’ve seen is that there is a villain that afflicts each of these stages:
• You encounter a choice. But narrow framing makes you miss options.
• You analyze your options. But the confirmation bias leads you to gather self-serving information.
• You make a choice. But short-term emotion will often tempt you to make the wrong one.
• Then you live with it. But you’ll often be overconfident about how the future will unfold.
So, at this point, we know what we’re up against. We know the four top villains of decision making. We also know that the classic pros-and-cons approach is not well suited to fighting these villains; in fact, it doesn’t meaningfully counteract any of them.
Now we can turn our attention to a more optimistic question: What’s a process that will help us overcome these villains and make better choices?

1. You encounter a choice. But narrow framing makes you miss options. So …
→ Widen Your Options. How can you expand your set of choices? We’ll study the habits of people who are expert at uncovering new options, including a college-selection adviser, some executives whose businesses survived (and even thrived) during global recessions, and a boutique firm that has named some of the world’s top brands, including BlackBerry and Pentium.
2. You analyze your options. But the confirmation bias leads you to gather self-serving info. So …
→ Reality-Test Your Assumptions. How can you get outside your head and collect information that you can trust? We’ll learn how to ask craftier questions, how to turn a contentious meeting into a productive one in 30 seconds, and what kind of expert advice should make you suspicious.
3. You make a choice. But short-term emotion will often tempt you to make the wrong one. So …
→ Attain Distance Before Deciding. How can you overcome short-term emotion and conflicted feelings to make the best choice? We’ll discover how to triumph over manipulative car salesmen, why losing $50 is more painful than gaining $50 is pleasurable, and what simple question often makes agonizing decisions perfectly easy.
4. Then you live with it. But you’ll often be overconfident about how the future will unfold. So …
→ Prepare to Be Wrong. How can we plan for an uncertain future so that we give our decisions the best chance to succeed? We’ll show you how one woman scored a raise by mentally simulating the negotiation in advance, how you can rein in your spouse’s crazy business idea, and why it can be smart to warn new employees about how lousy their jobs will be.
Our goal in this book is to teach this four-step process for making better choices. Note the mnemonic WRAP, which captures the four verbs. We like the notion of a process that “wraps” around your usual way of making decisions, helping to protect you from some of the biases we’ve identified.
The four steps in the WRAP model are sequential; in general, you can follow them in order—but not rigidly so. Sometimes you’ll double back based on something you’ve learned. For example, in the course of gathering information to Reality-Test Your Assumptions, you might discover a new option you hadn’t considered before. Other times, you won’t need all of the steps. A long-awaited promotion probably won’t require much distance before you accept and pop the champagne.
At its core, the WRAP model urges you to switch from “auto spotlight” to manual spotlight. Rather than make choices based on what naturally comes to your attention—visceral emotions, self-serving information, overconfident predictions, and so on—you deliberately illuminate more strategic spots. You sweep your light over a broader landscape and point it into hidden corners.

. Danny Kahneman: “A remarkable aspect of your mental life is that you are rarely stumped.”
    •  Should Shannon fire Clive? We form opinions effortlessly.
    2. What’s in our spotlight = the most accessible information + our interpretation of that information. But that will rarely be all that we need to make a good decision.
    3. Our decision “track record” isn’t great. Trusting our guts or conducting rigorous analysis won’t fix it. But a good process will.
    •  Study: “Process mattered more than analysis—by a factor of six.”
    4. We can defeat the four villains of decision making by learning to shift our spotlights.
    5. Villain 1: Narrow framing (unduly limiting the options we consider)
    •  HopeLab had five firms work simultaneously on stage 1; “Can I do this AND that?”
    6. Villain 2: The confirmation bias (seeking out information that bolsters our beliefs)
    •  The tone-deaf American Idol contestant …
    •  Lovallo: “Confirmation bias is probably the single biggest problem in business.”
    7. Villain 3: Short-term emotion (being swayed by emotions that will fade)
    •  Intel’s Andy Grove got distance by asking, “What would our successors do?”
    8. Villain 4: Overconfidence (having too much faith in our predictions)
• “Four-piece groups with guitars, particularly, are finished.”
    9. The pros-and-cons process won’t correct these problems. But the WRAP process will.
    •  Joseph Priestley conquered all four villains.
    10. To make better decisions, use the WRAP process:
Widen Your Options.
Reality-Test Your Assumptions.
Attain Distance Before Deciding.
Prepare to Be Wrong.
