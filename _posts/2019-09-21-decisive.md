Decisions are hard because of four villains: 1) Narrow Framing 2) Confirmation Bias 3) Short Term Emotion and 4) Overconfidence. Fighting these villains can be done using the Heath brothers' heros in the WARPed framework 1) Widen Your Options. 2) Reality-Test Your Assumptions 3) Attain Distance Before Deciding. 4) Prepare to Be Wrong.
