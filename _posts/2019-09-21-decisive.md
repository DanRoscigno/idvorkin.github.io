Decisions are hard because of four villains: 1) Narrow Framing 2) Confirmation Bias 3) Short Term Emotion and 4) Overconfidence. Fighting these villains can be done using the Heath brothers' heros in the WARPed framework 1) Widen Your Options. 2) Reality-Test Your Assumptions 3) Attain Distance Before Deciding. 4) Prepare to Be Wrong.

A typical decision progresses through the following stages, with a villain appearing at each stage, but a weapon appropriate to each villain.

### Decision making in a nut-shell

**Stage 1: You encounter a choice.**

- But **narrow framing** makes you miss options. So …
- **Widen Your Options** How can you expand your set of choices?

**Stage 2: You analyze your options.**

- But the **confirmation bias** leads you to gather self-serving info. So …
- **Reality-Test Your Assumptions** How can you get outside your head and collect information that you can trust?

**Stage 3: You make a choice**

- But **short-term emotion** will often tempt you to make the wrong one. So …
- **Attain Distance Before Deciding** How can you overcome short-term emotion and conflicted feelings to make the best choice?

**Stage 4: Then you live with it.**

- But you’ll often be **overconfident** about how the future will unfold. So …
- **Prepare to Be Wrong** How can we plan for an uncertain future so that we give our decisions the best chance to succeed?

### Widen Your Options

Break out of a narrow frame and expand the set of options you consider:

• Expand your options.
• Consider opportunity cost.
• Run the “vanishing options test.”
• Multitrack – think AND not OR.
• Toggle between the promotion and prevention mindsets.
• Find someone who has solved your problem.
• Try “laddering.”

#### Expand your options.

Heidi Price helps families widen their options for college because she knows the landscape of choices so well. Could you locate someone who would have an equally broad knowledge of options in your domain? You’re seeking someone who could help shift your spotlight to options that you wouldn’t normally consider.

#### The vanishing options test.

If you’re skeptical that people are not considering the full range of their options, run the Vanishing Options test. Say: “That option you were considering? Yep, it just disappeared. Now what are you going to do?”

#### Consider opportunity cost.

Think of a “yardstick” you could use to measure the opportunity cost of the time or money you are about to invest. (Recall that Eisenhower compared the cost of a new bomber to schoolhouses, power plants, and hospitals.) For business investments, you could consider a yardstick like: How many additional customer service reps or salespeople could we hire instead of making this investment? (Would we be better off?) For a personal expense, the yardsticks might include: How many songs could you download? How many dinners out could you have? Or how much extra time could you spend with your kids?

People don’t naturally consider their opportunity costs. Ask them, “What’s the next best use of the resources you’re talking about spending?” Force them to push their spotlights around by asking about different domains: For instance, if they’re waffling about whether to remodel their bathroom, ask whether they might be happier spending the money on a vacation or new furniture for the family room. You’re in a better position to help them avoid narrow frames and your probing can help them clarify their preferences.

#### Multitrack – think AND not OR. Always think AND not OR.

Can you follow multiple paths at once? If not, can you embrace one and sample another? (E.g., if you’re contemplating a career shift, you might keep your current job but volunteer a few hours somewhere else)

Think AND not OR. Describe all your options on one piece of paper (or a whiteboard at work), then compare and contrast to spot patterns. See if you can cobble together a “Perfect 10” option that combines the best features of multiple alternatives.

When Anne Mulcahy turned around Xerox, she knew that personnel decisions were the most important. She forced people to consider at least three candidates for any open position. If you’re a manager, can you require 3 options? Tell people to imagine that the ultimate decision will be madeby someone else—as in the kid’s game of divide and choose--—that way, they’ll cultivate 3 high-quality alternatives.

Try a decision technique recommended by Silicon Valley venture capitalist, Randy Komisar: before brainstorming about a topic, ask everyone to write down their ideas privately on a piece of paper. Then, go around the table and have people share one idea at a time—logging the answers on a white board—until all ideas are exhausted. Then, and only then, start your discussion. (This keeps the discussion from starting and staying on a single narrow track determined by

#### Toggle between the promotion and prevention mindsets.

For promotion: Suppose you had a sudden windfall of time (or money). How would you spend it? For prevention: Suppose there was a traumatic 25% cutback. How would you handle it? This “toggling” can help you spot new options that might combine elements of both.

Does your decision process compel people to consider both the prevention and promotion focus? The “SWOT” framework does, for instance. (It includes
“Strengths and Opportunities” but also “Weaknesses and Threats.”)

#### Find someone who has solved your problem.

The internet is a handy place to look for someone who’s solved your problem. Spend 20 minutes on an internet search, using 3-4 keywords that relate to your predicament. It sounds simple, but consider this finding: A study in medicine found that 58% of diagnostic cases in the New England Journal of Medicine—selected because they involve tricky clinical diagnoses—could be solved using this methodology. If your dilemma is more common, you’ll likely do better.

Send an email to 5 people in your network who aren’t close friends or colleagues. Describe your dilemma and ask if they know anyone who might have some insights. (The motivation here is to tap different networks—most of your friends and close colleagues probably know each other, so their networks aren’t as independent and you probably already know what they know.)

#### Laddering

“On this issue you’re struggling with, what’s the closest thing to a ‘success’ you’ve seen to date in your life (or organization)?” If they can answer that, you’ve got a bright spot. Analyze it so that you can potentially reproduce it. [For more depth on the idea of “bright spots,” see Chapter 2 in our previous book, Switch.]

Can you point people toward another arena/field/ group who has tackled a similar problem? Lexicon gets name designers to consider a range of alternatives by thinking of other domains where solutions might arise—one group trying to name the Pentium microprocessor was assigned to think of names for high performance skis.
