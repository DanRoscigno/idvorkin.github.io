I've had multiple people ask for my book recommendations on depression on bipolar disorder.  Here's the list:

(The Noonday Demon: An Atlas Of Depression)[http://www.amazon.com/Noonday-Demon-Atlas-Depression/dp/1501123882/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1455117245&sr=8-1&keywords=atlas+of+depression]
An extremely well written book about depression. It helps a reader understand the experience of depression from a superb story teller. The author also has a gripping TED talk.

(An Unquiet Mind: A Memoir of Moods and Madness)[http://www.amazon.com/Unquiet-Mind-Memoir-Moods-Madness/dp/0679763309/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1455117218&sr=8-1&keywords=unquit+mind]
A psychiatrist's story of bi-polar disorder, a very well written personal memoir.  It gives a good feeling of the highs of Mania as well as the lows of depression. 

(Bipolar Disorder Survival Guide, Second Edition)[http://www.amazon.com/Bipolar-Disorder-Survival-Guide-Second/dp/1606235427/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1455117269&sr=8-1&keywords=bipolar+survival+guide]
An engineering manual for laymen on bi-polar disorder.  This is a great book if you'd like to understand the current medical knowledge around bi-polar disorder, as well as what you can do to for yourself and your loved ones.
