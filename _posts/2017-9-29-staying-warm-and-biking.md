*This post started life as a list of cold weather biking gadgets, but I find I'm more often referring products I use when I'm not biking, so I'm forking the article to cover both. Bicycle specific stuff at the bottom.*  

### Staying warm on and off the bike

I get cold lots, here are some of the products I use to stay warm.  

**USB [Hand Warmers](http://www.amazon.com/EnergyFlux-4400mAh-Rechargeable-Double-Sided-External/dp/B00G4VQ6CA/ref=sr_1_4?s=sporting-goods&ie=UTF8&qid=1448076345&sr=1-4&keywords=usb+hand+warmer) -** It's pretty awesome to be able to warm up your hands in a jiffy. It doubles as a battery charger as well. They also come in a [larger size](http://www.amazon.com/EnergyFlux-Enduro-7800mAh-Rechargeable-double-sided/dp/B00Q7Q2KFO/ref=pd_sim_468_2?ie=UTF8&dpID=41obvKhFEiL&dpSrc=sims&preST=_AC_UL160_SR160%2C160_&refRID=197N5FQ1VKS71HSJCR1D), I haven't decide which size I like more, but I always have a pair in my pants - they are awesome.  

**[Mattress Pad Heater](http://www.amazon.com/Sunbeam-Quilted-Polyester-Mattress-Controller/dp/B00FHW8QI4/ref=pd_sim_201_1?ie=UTF8&dpID=41kUrfJ92dL&dpSrc=sims&preST=_AC_UL160_SR160%2C160_&refRID=1A3EQGNWVC4A7J37X08B) - **Don't know what this? Buy one know, kiss me later. </div>

**[Toe Covers](http://www.amazon.com/Meister-Thermal-Neoprene-Booties-Cycling/dp/B00QW10ZHO/ref=sr_1_7?ie=UTF8&qid=1448076697&sr=8-7&keywords=toe+warmers) - **These work pretty well to keep your feet warm. They're easy to lose track of though.</div>

**Gloves For Sorta Cold**- [Pearl iZUMi Cyclone Glove](https://www.amazon.com/Pearl-Izumi-Cyclone-Cycling-Glove/dp/B00JNAIXLG/ref=sr_1_1?s=sporting-goods&ie=UTF8&qid=1483063151&sr=1-1&keywords=Pearl%2BIzumi%2BCyclone&th=1)I wear these as my winter gloves as well as bike gloves. They are not water proof. Gloves need to fit you so make sure to try these on at a store before ordering online.  

**Gloves For Cold or Wet** - [Pearl Izumi Men's AmFIBGlove](https://www.amazon.com/Pearl-Izumi-AMFIB-Gloves-Medium/dp/B00SOMS2MY/ref=sr_1_2?s=sporting-goods&ie=UTF8&qid=1483063243&sr=1-2&keywords=Pearl+Izumi+Amfib+glove);  They are bulky, if it's not soaking or cold out, I'd much rather wear the cyclones. Gloves need to fit you so make sure to try these on at a store before ordering online. These gloves come in both 4 and 3 finger versions.  

**Thermal Compression Top/Pants - **[Sub Sports](http://www.amazon.com/Sub-Sports-Compression-Layer-Sleeve/dp/B00D5WNYFI/ref=sr_1_2?s=sporting-goods&ie=UTF8&qid=1448076146&sr=1-2&keywords=compression+top) - A skin tight thin, breathable warming layer. If you've never used a compression fabrics before they are weird, but they breathe, and keep you warm with no bulk.  

**[Insulated Pants -](http://www.duluthtrading.com/store/product/mens-fleece-lined-fire-hose-work-pants-34513.aspx?kw=lined%20pants&processor=content) **A bit heavy, but it's like heaven on earth. If you're male, check 'em out.  

### On the bike

I keep getting asked for winter bike gear recommendations so here is my list.   This stuff is expensive, but awesome. When you're on a 50 mile bike ride in the dark Seattle rain you'll be glad you bought the good stuff instead of the cheap crap  like your friend who quit biking. Each of these products has been through 100's maybe even a 1000  miles with out fail (except my gloves which I often lose).  

**Waterproof Jacket** - If you're feeling poor the [REI Stratos Jacket](http://www.rei.com/product/819019/novara-stratos-20-bike-jacket-mens). If you're feeling rich the [Shower Pass Elite](http://www.rei.com/product/838526/showers-pass-elite-21-bike-jacket-mens).  If you're feeling rich and want a jacket to use while off the bike, check out the [Shower's Pass Refuge](https://www.westernbikeworks.com/product/showers-pass-mens-refuge-rain-jacket?v=negr00m&adl=1&utm_campaign=products&utm_source=google&utm_medium=base&adl=1&gclid=Cj0KEQiAhZPDBRCz642XqYOCpb8BEiQANUcwT1pLi3iADk1YOcEnX6TBH6TpazZKSzZARkrjIbfjgUEaAuuh8P8HAQ).  

**Bike Tights **[Pearl iZUMi Men's AmFIB Cycling Tight](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003BLOS4Y/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=ighe-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B003BLOS4Y)  - sure you look a little fruity, but I guarantee you, everyone who's serious is wearing these.  

**Bike Rain Pants ** - If I don't want to wear tights and it's raining I've got the [shower pass club convertible](https://www.showerspass.com/products/mens-club-convertible-2-pant), they're the best I've found, but I don't love them since the length doesn't work for me.  

**Panniers** - [Orltieb](http://www.rei.com/search?query=orltieb+pannier) - I couldn't believe I spent 200$ on a set of saddle bags, but true story, I bought the 50$ kind, then the 100$ kind then finally these, and I've used them for 8 years with a single problem.  

**Light** - I'd recommend a minimum of  600 lumens, and make sure it can charge over USB.   I currently use the [urban 800](http://www.lightandmotion.com/the-perfect-light/on-bike/road/urban-800-fast-charge).  I used to use the  [Taz 1200](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008KKNPCM/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B008KKNPCM&linkCode=as2&tag=ighe-20), but it was too bulky, and I don't need that many lumens

### Other bike accoutrements

**Head Phones** - [Aftershokz Air](https://aftershokz.com/products/trekz-air) are bone conduction headphones that let you listen to music without blocking the street noise.  Fantastic product. 

### Brompton Specific

As you know, I love my Brompton, here's a my recommended [accoutrements.](http://idvorkin.github.io/brompton-toys)
