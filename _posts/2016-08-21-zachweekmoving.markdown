When you take a photo on the iPhone, it captures a few seconds of video at the same time, Apple calls this feature live photos. 

_To interact with the live photo hover over it with your mouse, or touch it with your finger._

Live photos provides a more emotional engaging photo experience - and once you use live photos, you find dead photos - well dead.

Unfortunately, few apps or web pages have support for live photos.  I was curious how hard it would be to add live photos to my blog, and here's what I found out:

The html and javascript code is trivial - (well it was once I copied the code from [David Anson](https://github.com/DavidAnson/live-photo-web) :). The hard part is getting the media ready - getting it off your phone, renaming, resizing and transcoding.  

I'm not sure if I'll go to trouble to add live photo images to my blogging work flow, but I sure wish blogger (my personal blog site would).
